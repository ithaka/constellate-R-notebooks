# Getting Started with R

Welcome to Constellate lab with R! This lesson introduces the basics of RStudio and R notebooks. If you are new to R, this is a good place to start.

**Use case** : For learners (detailed explanation, not ideal for researchers)

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Completion time:** 15 minutes

**Knowledge required:** None

**Knowledge recommended:** None

**Data format:** None

**Libraries used:** None

**Research pipeline:** None

# RStudio Interface

## The Four Panes

1.  **Source Pane (Top-Left)**: This is where you write your scripts, markdown files, and other text-based files.
2.  **Console Pane (Bottom-Left)**: This is where you can type R commands directly and see immediate results.
3.  **Environment/History Pane (Top-Right)**:
    -   **Environment**: Shows the variables, data, and functions you have created.
    -   **History**: Shows the history of commands you've executed.
4.  **Output Pane (Bottom-Right)**:
    -   **Files**: View and manage files in your working directory.
    -   **Plots**: Display plots generated by your R code.
    -   **Packages**: Manage R packages (libraries).
    -   **Help**: Access R documentation.
    -   **Viewer**: View local web content.

In this introductory series, we will use R notebooks to demonstrate how to use RStudio, how to write code in RStudio and how to do text analysis in RStudio. So, what are R notebooks?

# R Notebooks

This is your first R notebook. R notebooks are documents that contain both R code and explanatory content, such as text, images, figures, plots, videos and links. The R code chunks in an R notebook can be executed, modified and deleted. While you explore this notebook, feel free to modify the text, tinker with the code, and play with the RStudio environment. The "Visual" mode in the Source Pane will give you the most polished and presentable view of this notebook. The "Source" mode will reveal all the underlying markdown code, and it can be useful for making modifications to your code. If you are comfortable with markdown, you can modify the textual content in the "Source" mode. If you are not comfortable with markdown, you can stick with the "Visual" mode and just use point and click text editor commands at the top of the "Visual" mode.

To get the best experience, select the Visual mode in the Source Pane to read the R notebook. In today's lesson, you will learn how to create, modify and save your own R notebooks to share with others.

### Content in an R notebook

There are two kinds of content in R Notebooks:

1\. Markdown - The markdown content can contain text, images, videos and other kinds of explanatory content you might find on a regular website.

2\. Code chunks - Code chunks in an R notebook contain code in the R language that can be executed inline.

In the Visual mode, a code chunk can be distinguished from the markdown content by the fact that it has a gray background and contains `{r}`. In the source mode, a code chunk is additionally enclosed by triple back ticks (shift + \~, left of the 1 key).

```{r}
#This is a code chunk
```

In the code chunk above, there is no executable content, only a text comment. We can tell the text in the code chunk is a comment because it is prefixed with `#`. In R, any time a line begins with a `#` that line is a comment and will not be executed if the code is run. In a code chunk, comments are blueish-green in color.

## Hello World: Your first code

It is traditional in programming education to begin with a program that prints `Hello World`. In R, this is a simple task. Just like in Python, we will use the `print()` function. This function simply prints out whatever is inside the parentheses(). An an example, let's pass the string "Hello World!" to the print function:

`print("Hello World!")`

Let's write the code into a code chunk.

```{r}

```

## Create a code chunk

To create a code chunk in visual mode, you have a couple options.

1.  Go up to the top menu and click on **Insert -\> Executable Cell -\> R**. Note that you can write code chunks in other programming languages in an R notebook too.

2.  If you are on a windows, press **Ctrl + Alt + I.** If you are on a Mac, press **command + option + I**

## Run a code chunk

To run a code chunk, you also have a couple options.

1.  Go up to the top right to find the **Run** button. You will find the different running options in the drop down. To run the current code chunk, select **Run Current Chunk**. ![An animation showing how to run a code chunk](https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/run-R-code-chunk.gif)

2.  Click on the right-facing green triangle on the top right corner of the code chunk to run the current chunk. You also another option to run all code chunks above the current one. ![An animation showing how to run a code chunk](https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/run-current-code-chunk-green-triangle.gif)

3.  If you are on a Windows machine, press **Ctrl + Enter**; if you are on a Mac, press **command + return.** Note that if your code chunk has multiple lines of code, you will need to select all of the lines you would like to run and then press **Ctrl + Enter** or **command + return.**

## Modify the content

### Markdown

In an R notebook, the text content can be modified directly. You can use the point and click text editor commands at the top of the "Visual" mode to modify the text. You can also go to the "Source" mode to do the editing. In order to see the markdown content underlying the document, you will switch to the Source mode. This will show you the markdown syntax that creates headings, links, images, etc. When you want the markdown content to be rendered, just switch back to the Visual mode.

### Code

You can modify the code chunks by selecting the code chunk and changing it.

## Create a new R notebook

R notebooks are great for teaching because they allow both markdown content and code chunks. The markdown content, including text, images, links and videos, can help explain the code.

To create a new R notebook, go to the top menu, click on **File -\> New File -\> R Notebook**.

![An animation showing how to create a new notebook.](https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/create-new-rnotebook.gif)

In order to make the document easy to follow for the learners, open an R notebook in the visual mode. In this mode, all the markdown content will be rendered and viewers see the rendered text with formatting or hyperlinks, images and videos instead of the markdown syntax underneath.
