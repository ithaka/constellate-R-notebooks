## What is Key Word in Context (KWIC) analysis?

Keyword in context (KWIC) is an analysis that looks at a word and its every occurrence in a text to find out its meaning and usage. KWIC analysis is inspired by Rupert Firth's observation that you will know a word's meaning, or sense, by looking at the other words around it. KWIC is often in the format as shown in the image below, with the keyword placed in a central column within a "context window," a chosen number of words or characters that occur both before and after the given word.

## Do it KWIC

In this section, we will walk through a simple example of KWIC analysis of *Moby Dick* step by step.

### Download the data

Let's download the two data files we will use to demonstrate KWIC analysis in this section.

```{r}
### get the data

## create a data folder in the current dir
cd <- getwd() # get the path to the current working directory
mkfldr <- "data" # make a folder titled "data"
dir.create(file.path(cd, mkfldr)) # create the data folder under the current working dir

## download the file
# get the url to the first file
melville_url <- "https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/melville.txt" 

# get the url to the second file
austen_url <- "https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/austen.txt"

# download the two files into the "data" folder
download.file(url = melville_url, destfile = "data/melville.txt")
download.file(url = austen_url, destfile = "data/austen.txt")
```

We can retrieve the file names in the data folder using the `dir` function in R.

```{r}
files <- dir("data")  # retrieve file names from the "data" folder
files
```

We can make the display easier to read by giving each file an index.

```{r}
# get a vector containing the full names of all .txt files in the data folder, 
file_name <- dir("data", "\\.txt$", full.names=TRUE)

for (i in seq_along(file_name)){ # iterate through 1 to the total num of txt files
  cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ") # concatenate index number, file name, newline chr
}
```

There are two functions in the code chunk that we have not seen before. `seq_along()` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to the length of the object passed to it. For example, in the code chunk below, the vector stored in `vec` has three elements in it. If we apply `seq_along()` to it, we get a vector containing 1, 2, 3.

```{r}
# an example that demonstrates seq_along()
vec <- c("a", "b", "c")
seq_along(vec)
```

`cat()` converts its arguments to character strings, concatenates them, separating them by the string given to the `sep` parameter, and then prints them.

```{r}
# examples that demonstrates cat()

cat('Hello', 'World!', '\n', sep=' ')
cat(100, 'rows', sep=' ')
```

There is another function `paste()` in R that also concatenates strings. However, it will not print out the resulting string. Therefore, you can use `cat()` when you want to output strings to the console or write to a file. You can use `paste()` when you need to create a concatenated string for further use in your code.

```{r}
# paste() function
paste("Hello", "World!", collapse = ' ')
```

We can rewrite the code that displays the text files in the data folder into a function.

```{r}
### how the code is like before we rewrite it into a function

# get a vector containing the full names of all .txt files in the data folder, 
file_name <- dir("data", "\\.txt$", full.names=TRUE)

for (i in seq_along(file_name)){ # iterate through 1 to the total num of txt files
  cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ") # concatenate index number, file name, newline chr
}
```

```{r}
### how the code is like after we rewrite it into a function

# create a custom function to display the file names in a dir
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}

show_files("data") 
```

The syntax of a function might look a little bit complicated. Let's break it down to understand each component.

#### Function definition

The main components of an R function are: **function name**, **function parameters**, and **function body**.

The syntax of a function in R is as follows:

```         
function_name <- function(parameters){
  function body 
}
```

Let's use the `show_files()` function defined above as an example to understand each component.

##### Function name

```{r}
### Which part is the function name?
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}
```

Yes! `show_files` is the function name. When you define a function, you would want to make the function name concise but clear and meaningful so that the user who reads your code can easily understand what exactly this function does.

##### Function parameters

```{r}
### what are the function parameters?
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}
```

Within the parenthesis following the keyword `function`, we find two parameters. One is `dir_path`; another is `pattern` whose default value is set to "\\\\.txt\$". This means, the defined function takes two inputs. The actual values we pass to the parameters are called **arguments**.

##### Function body

```{r}
### what are the function parameters?
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}
```

The function body is *a set of commands inside the curly braces* that are run every time we call the function. In other words, in the function body, we put what we want the function to do.

##### Calling a function

To call a function, we just put the function name and add the necessary arguments inside the parenthesis.

```{r}
### Call a function in R
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}

show_files("data")
```

Note that when we call `show_files()`, we don't need to give an argument for the `pattern` parameter. This is because a default value "\\\\.txt\$" has been given to this parameter when we define the function. If we give a value to the `pattern` parameter which is different from the default value, the default value will be overriden by the value we give.

#### For loop

In the function body of `show_files()` function, we have a `for` loop. A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence. The basic syntax of a `for` loop is as follows:

```         
for (variable in sequence){
    expression
}
```

Let's start with a simple example. Pay special attention to the use of parentheses and curly braces.

```{r}
fruits <- c("apple", "pear", "banana") # create a vector
for (x in fruits) { # iterate over the values in the defined vector
  print(x) # print each value
}
```

In this simple example, in the body of the `for` loop we only have a `print` statement. However, to make it more interesting, we could add a filtering condition. Suppose we would like to iterate over the fruits but only print out the fruit if it is "banana". How do we do it?

```{r}
fruits <- c("apple", "pear", "banana") # create a vector
for (x in fruits) {# iterate over the values in the defined vector
  if (x == "banana"){
  print(x) # print out the fruit if it is banana
  }
}
```

Now, let's go back to the `show_files()` function and focus on the `for` loop in its function body.

```{r}
show_files <- function(dir_path, pattern="\\.txt$"){
  file_name <- dir(dir_path, pattern, full.names=TRUE)
  for (i in seq_along(file_name)){
    cat(i, file_name[i], "\n", sep=" ")
  }
}

# call the function
show_files("data")
```

We know the data folder contains two files. Therefore, when we pass "data" to the `show_files()` function, the `for` loop iterates over a sequence containing 1 and 2.

With the knowledge of functions and `for` loop, we are ready to jump into the KWIC analysis!

### Break up text into tokens

In order to do a KWIC analysis, we will need to break up a text into tokens. In [R-basics-1](./R-basics-1.Rmd), we have learned that the `unnest_tokens()` function from the `tidytext` library can help us tokenize a text.

```{r}
### use unnest_tokens() to tokenize text
library(tidyverse) # import library
library(tidytext) # import library
austen <- scan("data/austen.txt", what = 'character', sep = '\n') # read in the text 
austen <- as_tibble(austen) # turn text into a tibble
# view(head(austen, 10)) # preview the raw data 
austen_words <- unnest_tokens(austen, strip_punct = FALSE, output=word, input=value) # tokenization
```

### Get the index of keyword

To identify the index of the keyword, we will use the `which()` function. The `which()` function in R is used to identify the indices of elements in a logical vector that are TRUE.

```{r}
### Choose a word to get its context
pos_w = which(austen_words=='anguish')
pos_w
```

We can confirm that in the tibble stored in austen_words, row 66603 and row 128311 contain the word "anguish" in them.

```{r}
# confirm that the two indices are the indices for the keyword
austen_words[['word']][66603]
austen_words[['word']][128311]
```

If we would like to grab the preceding and the following word of the target word, we could do so by iterating through the indices in the `pos_w` vector and for each position, we get the neighboring words and concatenate them with the target word.

### Set a context window to get KWIC line

```{r}
for (pos in pos_w){ # for each position in pos_w
  start = pos - 1
  end = pos + 1
  words <- (austen_words %>% slice(start:end))[['word']]
  cat(words, "\n", sep=" ")
}
```

Of course, you can enlarge the context window by adjusting the starting and ending index.

```{r}
for (pos in pos_w){ # for each position in pos_w
  start = pos - 10
  end = pos + 10
  words <- (austen_words %>% slice(start:end))[['word']]
  cat(words, '\n\n', sep=' ') # concatenate the target word with the neighboring words
}
```

### Putting everything together

Now that you know how to read in the data from a txt file, break it up into tokens, identify the index of a certain keyword and extract the KWIC lines for that particular keyword with a certain context size, you can put everything together to do KWIC analysis of a text!

Suppose we would like to do a KWIC analysis of *Moby Dick*. The keyword we are interested in is "dog". We would like to get five tokens on either side of the keyword. Let's write a script to do KWIC.

```{r}
### create a five-word KWIC list of "dog" in Moby Dick
### in this exercise, we write the scripts in a step-by-step way
melville <- scan("./data/melville.txt", what='character', sep='\n') # read in the data
melville <- as_tibble(melville) # read data as a tibble
melville_words <- unnest_tokens(melville, strip_punct = FALSE, output=word, input=value) # tokenization
pos_dog <- which(melville_words=='dog') # find the indices for the word dog
num_dash = paste(replicate(10, '-')) ## define dash counts for later printing
for (i in seq_along(pos_dog)){# for each position in position_dog
  start = pos_dog[i] - 5
  end = pos_dog[i] + 5
  kwic_words <- (melville_words %>% slice(start:end))[['word']]
  kwic_words[which(kwic_words == 'dog')] <- paste('[', 'dog', ']', sep='') #highlight keyword
  cat(num_dash, i, num_dash)
  cat('\n')
  cat(kwic_words, '\n', sep=' ')
}
```

### Exercise 1

It's your turn! Using what you have learned, write a function that will produce a *five-word* KWIC list for all occurrences of the word *dog* in *Sense and Sensibility*. Note that the code script we wrote for the KWIC analysis of *Mody Dick* is a step-by-step script without putting everything into a function. In this exercise, you are supposed to write a function that takes in the file `austen.txt` in the data folder and output the *five-word* KWIC list of the keyword *dog*.

```{r}
### write a script to get a five-word KWIC list of the word "dog" in Sense and Sensibility

```

## Do it KWICer

In this section, you will learn how to abstract the code in the last section to create an interactive and reusable application to create KWIC lines for a certain file without the need to hard code the file location and key word in the function.

### Elicit user input

R has some built-in functions that can be used to elicit user input. Instead of giving the file path to the scan function to open a file, we can use the `file.choose()` function, which will prompt the user to navigate the file system to choose a file to open. In the console pane, enter the code in the following cell to try.

```{r}
# try the file.choose() function
text <- scan(file.choose(), what='character', sep='\n')
```

R also has another built-in function `readline`, which is akin to the `input` function in Python. Basically, it elicits user input and stores it in a variable. Run the following code cell and enter an input in the console.

```{r}
# try the readline function
year <- readline("What year was Moby Dick published? ")
```

After we entered 1851 in the console, the input is assigned to the variable `year`. We can confirm it by checking the value stored in `year`.

```{r}
year
```

Note that the user input is stored as a string. We can use the `typeof()` function to confirm it.

```{r}
typeof(year) # check the type of the value stored in the variable year
```

### Rewrite the function from previous section

Now, let's rewrite the KWIC function we created in the last section to make it accept a file, a keyword, a context size from the user and output KWIC lines of the given keyword with the given context window size from the given file.

```{r}
# abstract the function from previous section to accept user input
kwicer <- function(dir_path){ # define a function called kwicer
file_id <- as.numeric(readline(paste('Select a file using its index: ', show_files(dir_path), sep=" "))) # elicit file choice from user and turn it to integer
keyword <- readline("Enter a keyword: ") # elicit a keyword from user
context <- as.numeric(readline("What is the context size? ")) # elicit a context size from user
file_path <- file.path(dir_path, dir(dir_path)[file_id]) # set the file path based on user choices from above
file <- scan(file_path, what="character", sep="\n") # read in the data from file
file <- as_tibble(file) # turn text into a tibble
file_words <- unnest_tokens(file, strip_punct = FALSE, output=word, input=value)  #tokenization
pos_keyword <- which(file_words == keyword) # find the indices of the keyword
for (i in seq_along(pos_keyword)){
  start <- pos_keyword[i] - context 
  if (start < 1){
    start <- 1
  } # get the index of the starting word in a kwic line
  end <- pos_keyword[i] + context
  if (end >= nrow(file_words)){
    end <- nrow(file_words)
  } # get the index of the ending word in a kwic line
  kwic_line <- paste((file_words %>% slice(start:end))[['word']], collapse=" ")
  kwic_line[which(kwic_line == keyword)] <- paste("[", keyword, "]", sep = "") # highlight the keyword using square brackets
  num_dash = paste(replicate(10, '-')) 
  cat(num_dash, i, num_dash)
  cat("\n")
  cat(kwic_line, "\n")
}
}

# call the function to see how it operates
kwicer("data")
```

```{r}
### an example demonstrating the start and end of a kwic line
vec <- c('John', 'has', 'a', 'dog', 'that', 'is', '10', 'years', 'old', 'now')
pos_dog <- which(vec=='dog')

# get a kwic line for 'dog' with 5 tokens on either side in the naive way
# start <- pos_dog - 5
# end <- pos_dog + 5
# kwic_line <- vec[start:end]

# get a kwic line with edge case in mind
start <- pos_dog - 5
end <- pos_dog + 5
if (start < 1){
  start <- 1
}
if (end > length(vec)){
  end <- length(vec)
}
kwic_line <- vec[start:end]
kwic_line
```

## Write the output into a file

Note that the KWIC lines we get as output from the previous sections are not stored in any form. This means, if you sign out of the current session and come back later, your output KWIC lines are lost. However, in real life, after processing files and obtaining some kind of output, we would want to store the output in a file to continue working in the future.

In this section, a sample code chunk that demonstrates how to write the KWIC lines we get from a file into a `.csv` file is given. A `.csv` file is used to store tabular data that can be opened by Excel, Google Sheets or other software that can read tabular data. We will learn more in the next lesson, but feel free to play with the code and try exercise 2!

```{r}
# abstract the function from previous section to accept user input
kwicer <- function(dir_path){ # define a function called kwicer
file_id <- as.numeric(readline(paste('Select a file using its index: ', show_files(dir_path), sep=' '))) # elicit file choice from user and turn it to integer
keyword <- readline("Enter a keyword: ") # elicit a keyword from user
context <- as.numeric(readline("What is the context size? ")) # elicit a context size from user
file_path <- file.path(dir_path, dir(dir_path)[file_id]) # set the file path based on user choices from above
file <- scan(file_path, what="character", sep="\n") # read in the data from file
file <- as_tibble(file) # turn text into a tibble
file_words <- unnest_tokens(file, strip_punct = FALSE, output=word, input=value)  #tokenization
pos_keyword <- which(file_words == keyword) # find the indices of the keyword
output_tibble <- as_tibble(
  matrix(nrow=length(pos_keyword), ncol=3) # create an empty tibble
)
colnames(output_tibble) <- c("position", "keyword", "kwic") # name the columns
for (i in seq_along(pos_keyword)){
  start <- pos_keyword[i] - context 
  if (start < 1){
    start <- 1
  } # get the index of the starting word in a kwic line
  end <- pos_keyword[i] + context
  if (end >= nrow(file_words)){
    end <- nrow(file_words)
  } # get the index of the ending word in a kwic line
  kwic_line <- paste((file_words %>% slice(start:end))[['word']], collapse=" ")
  kwic_line[which(kwic_line == keyword)] <- paste("[", keyword, "]", sep = "") # highlight the keyword using square brackets
  df_row <- cbind(pos_keyword[i], keyword, kwic_line) # bind keyword pos, keyword and kwic as cols
  output_tibble[i,] <- df_row # write the data into row
}
  out_file <- paste(
    keyword, "kwic", context, "words", "in", 
    "context", dir(dir_path)[file_id],"csv", sep=".")
  write.csv(output_tibble, file.path("data", out_file))
# return(output_tibble)
}

# call the function to see how it operates
kwicer("data")
```

### Exercise 2

It's your turn! Using what you have learned about how to elicit user input, could you revise the code chunk above such that the function will ask the user if they would like to write the output into a .csv file? If the user gives a positive answer, then write the output into a csv file; otherwise, don't do so.

```{r}
### revise the code in the previous cell such that 
### the function will store the output in a csv file if user asks it to do so
### and will not do so otherwise

```
