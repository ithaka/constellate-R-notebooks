War in Scandinavia",,"the uneasy neutrality which the


scandinavian countries have sought


to preserve by every means at their


command since the outbreak of war
IN Europe some eight months ago.
Through the veil of censorship


speedily imposed by the invading


forces have come only the most


meager reports of what is happen


Ing in the new war zone. But Ger


tain facts stand out.


Norway has elected to fight. Early


reports of air raids at Oslo, the
evacuation of civilians and the flight


of the Norwegian government from


that exposed capital suggest that


Goering's bombers already may have
struck


Denmark, virtually helpless by


virtue of her geographical position,


apparently has offered no resistance
+ to the Germans. Her non-aggression
pact with the Reich apparently has


become another scrap of paper. Co.
penhagen is reported occupied, but
If there has been any fighting in
Denmark, no reports of it have leaked
through the censorship.


Sweden as yet presumably has not


been involved beyond the mining of
her ports on the Skagerrak and the
Kattegat, but, with fighting under
way in earnest in Norway, the Swedes
would have little chance to remain
at peace.


Attempting to justify her invasion
OF the neutral countries, the German
government has announced from
Berlin by radio that lin order to
counteract the actions against Den
mark and Norway (by Britain and
France) and to prevent a possible
hostile attack against these coun-
tries, the German Army has taken
these two countries under its pro-
lection. The strong forces of the
German Army have therefore in
vaded these countries this morning.""


So far as any known acts on the
part of the allies are concerned, this
flimsy pretext appears to be directed
to their action in mining three areas
along the Norwegian coast yesterday
In an effort to intercept shipments
of Swedish iron ore bound for Ger
man ports. But the published facts
are all against Germany.


Obviously, the invasion of Norway
and Denmark was not organized
overnight. 1t must have been in
process of preparation for some
time. Today's developments clear
up the mystery of the German
troopship sunk four miles off the
Norwegian coast yesterday by a
British submarine. This transport
was sunk at about the time the
sallied mines were laid and it is a
reasonable assumption that the
German soldiers had embarked be-
fore the mines were laid. Certainly
they were organized for the advance
Son Norway prior to the mine laying.
These facts destroy GerSlany's at

sact of retaliation for the laying of
J, the mines. That claim, as has been
the case with so many German as

on the falsity of her other premise,
and on her whole unsavory record
for mendacity, the attempt to i'm
7pute hostile designs to France and
Britain surely will be rejected by
Tworld opinion until such time as
! convincing evidence to the contrary
SIS forthcoming.


I Just what course France and
{ Britain will elect to take. now that
Z the scene of action has shifted to
( the Scandinavian theater, is for them
i to decide. But that they must act

 London, April 12-lUP)-Stock- holm reports said today that Adolf Hitler and his henchmen personally would lead the Nazis in their Arm ageddon at Leipzig, throwing all their secret weapons and possibly poison gas into a climactic battle to the death.

 The Stockholm Tidningen quoted military sources in Berlin as say- ing that the final decision battle of Germany would be fought on the historic Napoleonic battlefield at Leipzig.

 Hitler, high party members and Nazi Gauleiters or district leaders intend to die with Germany on the last battlefield, the unconfirmed Stockholm report said.

 Face to face with utter defeat and extinction, the Nazi chieftains were reported preparing to throw every last ounce of their fast dwin- ding resources into their valedic- tory.

 Berlin itself indicated that the Nazis believed their doom to be at hand.

 ""The Church Bell Wlll

 Ring For the Kremlln Again""

 ""If had to pick out any insti- tuition certain to survive the pres- ent world madness, I should uK- hesitatingly put my hand on the Roman Catholic Church"" Thus writes Thomas Lomax Hunter, non-C -Catholic communist of the Richmond Times Dispatch.

 MT. Hunters statement appeared in his column ""As It Appears To The Cavalier"" and continues in part as follows:

 Against ""uncompromising dog. matic supernaturalism"" the arrows of materialistic rationalism are as i'm potent as if they were fired against the Milky Way. In this I see the strongest proof and prom ise of endurance in the Catholic Church. Behind those bulwarkS it is inviricible. It has outlived many gchisms and 1t will outlive many more. The schisms change and perish but the Catholic Church remains. Wars and revolutions cannot shake 1t. Mans most faI1- tastic atheisins standing atiptoe cannot touch 1t. It is coeval with Christianity, and It's history is the history of the Christian church. TO its sons and daughters its dogmas are eternally and in- defectibly true. While those dog- mas are 'indefectibly true the Church will remain itnpregnable. Tt lived through the overthrow of the Roman Empire; the rise of Northumberland, and turned 1t back from the conquest of Europe at Tours and Lepanto. It endured the terrors of the Tartar invasions. When hear politicians talking of the overthrow Of Christian civili. zation, l look ct the Roman Catholic Church and am com- fortcd. You can persecute 1t but you cannot kill 1t. stalin and Stalinisin are but 6 passing incl dent. The Church bell will ring for the Kremlin again.

 Tt has seen the likes of Hitler and Hitlerism 6 thousand times. It Is the one institution that is not afraid of Hitler. It detied Nero, Commodus, Caracalia, Caligula and other bloody minded despots. If had to pick out any institution certain to survive the present world madness, I should unhesit- atingly put my hand on the Catholic Church. Armored In It's 'uncompromlsing supernaturalism, there 1t stands eternal and in- defectible.""

 Senator Houston, Convert

 Tho elderly Senator Andrew Jackson Houston of Texas who has been appointed by Gov. w. Lee O'Daniel to serve the un- expired term of the latc Sen. Morris Sheppard, is 6 convert to tho Catholic Church. Eight years ago he was received Into the church and conforIned by the Most Rev. Christopher Bylne, of Galveston.

 Tn his conversion Senator Houston follows the example his illustriotis father, Gen. Sam Houston, who was also convert. Texas greatest hero, Sam Houston served as President of the Lone Star Republic before Texas was admitted to the Union.

 A Drexel HeIress

 Fifty years ago the name Drexel was written large on the facade of banks in New York, Philadelphia and Paris. It was a name of para. mount importance in the financial world. Three brothers, Francis, Anthony and Joseph were carrying on the banking firm established by their father. Today the Drexel name still stands high on the social register and still fits through the society pages Of the daily papers.

 But fifty years ago tho name of Katherine Drexel, daughter of the senior member of the firm, was taken from the society column and moved on to write Q beautiful page in the nobler portion of mans history. As 6 young girl Katherine Drexel had visited the South and West and was appalled, ct the conditions in which the Negroes and Indians lived. On 6 visit to Rome she urged Pope Leo XIII to establish an organization to aid these people. The earnestness of her plea led the Holy Father to remark that she had every indica- ton Of a vocation of service to these unfortunates. Two years later she entered a Novitiate In Pittsburg ahd after her profession in 1891, she began with thirteen novices and postulants the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. who added to their vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, the fourth VOW of laboring exclusively for the Indians and Negros.

Please understand me. The
men who hold those views may
be honorable men. But, people
of America, they do not believe
in the ability of democracy to
solve the great problem of today.
They have no faith in our way
of life.


They have granted the first
promise of the counter-revolu-

Hitler, for instance, insists upon.
They say that democracy and
free enterprise are decadent.
They say that ours is a dying
way of life.


You cannot expect these men,
with defeat in their hearts, to
fight successfully for our way of

ture you cannot expect to find
our way of life still existing
there, if these men are returned

Hardly any one familiar
with the situation believes
Adolf Hitler will placidly al

to make sudden offensive
thrusts, possibly Of a limited
nature, and the Allies are
not ignoring the possibility
that he may strike through

The propaganda men don't have to
make the best of what the various
military headquarters say after the

Against this super smooth mech
anism United States short-wave
radio has gone to war.


It's methods and tactics are very
different. And United States short
wave men have reasons for the
tactics they employ.


So long as United States forces
are not on the continent, they are
more concerned with propaganda as
a psychological weapon rather than
as military weapon.


Their work is directed at the
people of enemy lands and the oc-
cupied countries. Their aim is to
bring despair to the first, hope to
the latter.


Keep News Truthful.


Almost uniform procedure over
the IA great short-wave transmit
ters directed at enemy dominated
people is program combining Is
minutes of news and Is minutes of
editorials and news features.


Uniform belief among the big
stations and the Government agency
is that news and editorials must be
kept separate. Truth in the news,
they believe, is the biggest drawing
card for listeners abroad, because
Europeans are sick and tired of
propaganda""


Says Elmer Davis, director of the
Office of War Information:


""Democracies have good story
to tell and they ought to tell it.
owl is telling it and will tell it in
increasing volume as our foreign
service expands. The news We
broadcast overseas is supplemented
in Allied and neutral countries by
general background information dis
tributed by our outposts in London,
Berne, Stockholm, Cairo, Ankara,
New Delhi, Chungking, etc. 9...tz


I'VE stick to the truth, for we be-
lieve the truth is on our side. To
enemy countries, we broadcast news
of the war. American production,

omissions as actual military security
may demand: but that news, in di-
rection and emphasis, is adjusted to
the particular interests of enemy
peoples so as to produce the psy-
Geological effect most conducive to
our victory""


Sample Of Editorial


Propaganda only really enters the
programs when the broadcaster gets
to his Is minutes of editorial. Even
then 1t is ""once over lightly form
of propaganda as the Germans
know 1t.

way which in the first World War

this, too, will be the way which will
suffice in this war""


Treatment in broadcasts directed
at Germany is to separate Germans
from Nazis. Attacks are directed at
officialdom and overlords, and the
people are identified as the long
suffering.


'Our two main aims"" says Ernest
Moth Of NBC, ""are to encourage a
split between the Nazi party and the

the author, ""the absence Of long-range

Short-sighted policies such as theirs

What we need is a far-sighted pro-
gram that recognizes that the nations

the pursuit of happiness so the individ-
ual nations must attempt to organize
government among themselves to insure

opinion on the extent Of presidential
powers in time of war or other ma
tional emergency was a large order.
Mr.. Murphy was justified in declin-
ing to render such an extraordinary
opinion. Senator Vandenburg, au-
thor of the resolution asking for the
Interpretation, conceded that the
Attorney Generals stand was ""prob-
ably sound under the precedents. 4""
AS Mr.. Murphy pointed out in his
letter to Vice President Garner in
response to the resolution, similar
requests for legal advice have been
respectfully refused by previous at
torneys general. In their book,
Federal Justice"" former Attorney
General Homer Cummings and his
assistant, Carl Mcfarland, have given
an interesting account of the origin
of the doctrine that the advisory
powers of the Department of Justice
and it's officials are strictly limited.
The doctrine was first specifically
recorded by Attorney General Will
liam Writ, who served from 1917 to
1929 When Writ took over his du-
ties he inherited no Office space, no
clerical staff, no records of any kind.
He soon found himself submerged
with requests for legal advice from
private citizens, firms, members of
Congress and minor Government
officials. He decided that it. would
be humanity impossible to comply
will all these requests with the linn
tied facilities at hand and he pro-
ceeded to seek an avenue of escape.
He found it by examining carefully
the Judiciary Act of 1889, which di-
rected the Attorney General to give
his advice and opinion upon ques-
tions of law when required -by the
President of the United States, or
when requested by the heads Of any
of the departments, touching on any
matters that may concern their de-
partments."" Writ, harassed by null
titudinous demands for legal advice
from many non-executive sources
including Congress - wrote: my
opinion is that the Attorney General
is not bound by the law as it now
stands to obey these calls""


Writ found it exceedingly difficult
to reject congressional requests for
legal opinions, however. Edmund
Randolph, first Attorney General,
had advised the House in 1892 that
Andrew Jackson was not entitled to
be paid for his services as district at
torney in the Southwest Territory,
and all of Wirt's other predecessors
had made it practice to give advice
to Congress on sundry matters. After
complying reluctantly with several
congressional requests, Writ finally
told Congress that he had been CIV
ing opinions merely as a matter of
courteSy-not because he was COM
PEELED by law to do so-and he sug-
gested that If the custom of asking
him for legal advice was to continue,
the Judiciary Act should be revised
to authorize such duties. Instead,
the houses of Congress resorted to
the scheme of asking for legal coun-
sci by way of the President or men,
bers of the cabinet. Writ then held
that the indirect and circuitous
mode"" used did not meet conditions
of the law. From that time on the
Department of Justice has adhered
rigidly to the rule against giving
legal advice to anybody except the
President and his cabinet-and then
only in matters pertaining to their
respective departments.


1t is clear, therefore, that Attorney
General Murphy had ample prece-
dent for declining to give the Senate
an opinion as to emergency execu-
tive authority. That he wished to
go as far as he legally could in sat-
isfying the curiosity of the Senate is
evidenced by the trouble he took to
compile list of approximately one
hundred laws from which the Presi-
dent derives varied wartime or emer-
gency powers. From these laws the
Senate itself is at liberty to draw it's
own conclusions. The list of laws is,
as Senator Vandenburg remarked,
formidable-but it does not follow
necessarily that the powers them
selves are formidable. The Consti-
tuition vested tremendous authority
in the executive branch, in time of
peace as well as of war. The conduct
of foreign relations in itself is a grave
responsibility. So is the command
of the Army and Navy. These are
reasons why the Office of President
of the United States is a sacred trust
and one of the most important
jobs in the world.


It is hoped that Hitler, often de-
nounced in chronological terms, may
prove to be insect OF the type that
gives one tremendous, vicious sting,"

a good, practical way to double cross

to the Churchill appeal was to re-
peat the statement that Italy is
the prisoner of the Mediterranean""
and that the League Of Nations
sanctions"" during the Ethiopian
War were a mortal insult to the
Italian people.


The next step was the attack upon
the British Pacific island of Nauru
by raider which few the japanese
flag. This is believed to have been
a Nazi ship and the purpose of the
raid-aside from the damage caused
seems to have been to cause
America to worry about the Pacific.
Since the triple alliance Of last sum-
mer between Germany, Italy and
Japan, it has been clear that Hitler
relied on American complications
with Japan to prevent our sending
effective aid to Britain. So far We
have not fallen for this game and
President Roosevelt has no inten-
ton Of doing so.


Roosevelt Hits at Appeasers.


The third development was the
Roosevelt flreside speech last Sum-
day. This was designed TO achieve
two purposes: First, to isolate and
render harmless the wealthy group
Of appeasers and pro-Nazis who
have been organizing for a big pub
licity campaign (modeled on the
Liberty League setup) to prevent
| aid to Britain. and second, to unity
public opinion behind a far more
aggressive program for defense and
support for the British in their war
/ against the dictators.


For some weeks there has been
a growing demand at Washington
that President Roosevelt should
give the country more leadership.
This demand was complicated by
the desire of a good many wealthy
and powerful groups that President
Roosevelt should create a defense
dictator, probably a businessman.
Generally speaking. the same group
who supported Willkie in the elec-
tion supported this plan. What also
made matters difficult for the Presi-
dent was the refusal of the lame
duck Congress to 60 home. Only
a handful of legislators were actu-
ally in Washington. but some busi-
ness could be transacted, and loud
est in their demands for action were
some of the worst licked and most
utterly discredited politicians in our
history. 1t was only when both Of
these forces had played themselves
out that the President believed that
the air had cleared sufficiently for
him to speak to a country which
would follow his leadership.


Sensation, Of the week was the
announcement Of the C. I. o. plan
to manufacture 500 airplanes a day.
This represents the best brains en-
gagged In the study of actual mass
production methods. 1t originated
with Philip Murray, the new C. I. o.
cairman, and was intrusted by him
to Thomas and Reuther of the
Automobile Workers Union. BY
this stroke Murray has restored TO
the c. I. o. the position of RESPONSE
BILE national leadership which It lost
when John L. Lewis went sour in
the spring of 1887.


White Resignation Possible.


Something to look out for is the
impending resignation of William
Allen White from the chairmanship
OF the Committee to Save America
by Aiding the Allies. Mr.. Whites
interview with the United Press
was the last straw. In this he
specifically repudiated the possibili-
ty that America might have to save
herself by entering the war and
rejected the plan of using American
naval vessels to convoy munitions
across the North Atlantic. Then he
turned around and repudiated his
own interview.


So far as the actual war is con-
cerned, the last week saw little i'm
portant change. Heavy SHOWS and
italian reinforcements checked the
Greek advance in Albania. The
Italian garrison in Bardia continued
to hold out, though surrounded by
the British, thus giving Graziani
time in which to organize his de-
fense further to the west in Libya.
German air raids and counter-raids
by the r. A. r. continued In the
Battle Of Britain. Germany used
the Christmas truce to rush troops
into Rumania for a possible drive
against Greece, Turkey or Russia
or to organize for a big spring at
tack In the Eastern Mediterranean.

Washington and London, Herr Goeb-
bells men say, are anxious to see the war
end. But while Washington is still
determined to enforce the unconditional
surrender policy-if it were in form
only-the British are quite willing to
throw it overheard for peace which
would satisfy public opinion and at the
same time preserve a Germany which
could be reconstructed to keep a balance
OF power in Europe


The slowness of our operations in
Europe, which is due to the fact that
the concentrations for the blows prom
ised at the Teheran conference have net
been completed, is being described in
the Reich as a proof of the intention Of
Britain not to lose too many men and
war materials since there are strong
prospects for an early negotiated peace.


The idea Is, of course, ridiculed in re-
sponsible quarters in Washington. which
maintain that nothing but the unconci-
tlonal surrender of the Reich with
either complete disarmament or utt-r
destruction of the Wehrmacht can
satisfy the Allies. The Russians ard
the British 3ay these quarters. solemnlv
pledged themselves at Teheran to
achieve this the final end.


The Goebbels propaganda. which il,
directed principally to the home front.
Is, according to American officials, one
OF the most significant indications that
the nome front is deteriorating rapidly.


Moreover, the reported propaganda is
intended to prepare the German public

with good reason, for the successes of
the German war machine thus far have
been at a heavy price. and il seems pos
sible that Germany will fail without Ital-
ian help at the right moment. and may
fail even with that help.


Many a German move of the past week
seems to have been with the intention OF
re-assuring Italy. The air raids in

velt's message last night to Chancellor
Hitler:


desire to acknowledge your excel
lency's reply to my telegram Of Sep
tember IS. I was confident that you
would coincide in the opinion I ex-
pressed regarding the unforeseeable
consequences and the incalculable dis
aster which would result to the entire
world from the outbreak OF European
war.


The question before the world today,
Mr.. Chancellor, Is not the question OF
errors Of judgment or Of injustices
committed in the past. It Is the ques-
ton Of the fate Of the world today
and tomorrow. The world asks Of US
who at his moment are heads Of ma
tions the supreme capacity to achieve
the destinies Of nations without forcing
upon them, Is = price, the mutilation
and death Of millions Of citizens.
Great War Provided Lesson.


Resort to force in the Great War
failed to bring tranquility. Victory
and defeat were alike sterile. That
lesson the world should have learned.
For that reason above all others
addressed on September rs my appeal
to your excellency and to the Presi-
dent Of Czechoslovakia and to the
prime ministers Of great Britain and
Of France.


The two points sought to empha-
size were, first, that all matters of
difference between the German gov
eminent and the Czechoslovak govern
ment could and should be settled by
pacific methods; and, second. that the
threatened alternative of the use of
force on q scale likely to result in q
general war Is rs unnecessary as it Is
unjustifable. It Is, therefore, su-
premely important that negotiations
should continue without interruption
until a fair and constructive solution
Is reached.


My conviction on these two points
Is deepened because responsible states
men have ofhcially stated that an
agreement in principle has already
been reached between the government
Of the German Reich and the gov
ernment Of Czechoslovakia, although
the precise time, method and detail
Of carrying out that agreement re-
main at issue.


Appeals for Continued Negotiations.


Whatever existing differences may
be, and whatever their merits may be
and upon them I do not and need
not undertake to pass-my appeal was
solely that negotiations be continued
until . peaceful settlement Is found,
and that thereby q resort to, force be
avoided.


Present negotiations still stand open.
They can be continued II you will give
the word. Should the need for sup
plementing them become evident,
nothing stands In the way of widening
their scope into = conference of all
the nations directly interested in the
present controversy. Such a meeting
to be held immediately-in some neu-
tral spot In Europe-would offer the
opportunity for this and correlated
questions to be solved In q spirit Of
justice. Of fair dealing, and, in all
human probability, with greater per-
manence.


: In my considered judgment, and in
the light Of the experience Of this
century, continued negotiations remain
the only way by which the immediate
problem can be disposed Of upon any
lasting basis."

 The situation appears to be grow ing rapidly more acute in the north- ern Caucasus and the Russians have acknowledged fresh Nazi advances at several points.

 In message from Josef Stalin to the Russian people he invoked the names of Russias great heroes of the past as an inspiration for the present crisis, recalling such fig ures as Alexander Nevsky, who beat the ancient Teutons. Mikhail Kutu- zov, whose resistance helped to turn Napoleon's Russian invasion into disaster.

 Retreat Cut off

 The German Command asserted today broadly that the Russian line of retreat to the East has been cut off at the great Don River Bend. but gave no details in their dis patches.

 The Red Star, Russian Army newspaper. said that in the gigantic seven-day battle raging at the Don River Bend above Stalingrad, in- volving thousands of troops. planes. field guns. tanks, the Germans have reached the eastern bank of the river in one sector but have been driven back.

 officials are reticent. The United States, however. stands behind, or parallel"" to. the French and Bri- tish in their desire to prevent Eu- ropean explosion. That statement is based on public utterances of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

 American diplomats also have spoken with some frankness abroad but. still, without committing the United States either to fight or not to fight.

 Support for Peace

 Both MT. Roosevelt and Hull, in their speeches, have asserted this governments support of any and all nations attempting to maintain peace, law, and order in interna- tional relations. That is the role in which Great Britain and France are deemed to be today in their opposition to further expansion by armed force or to policies likely to precipitate conflict.

 Unofficial re-eXamination of American policy followed reports from Webb Miller. European gen. eral manager of the United Press, that Europe believes that this gov- ernment is helping France and Great Britain morally in their ef- forts to ""stop Hitler. That belief is based on various official state- ments here and abroad, especially utterances of Joseph P. Kennedy, American ambassador to Great Bri- tain, and William 0. Bullitt, anl- bassador to France.

 No Discord of Advisers

 There is no suggestion of discord among MT. Roosevelt's diplomatic advisers here and in Europe. How ever, Bullitt and Kennedy are con- sidered more MT. Roosevelt's than Hull's men. Bullitt, 1t appears, would go further and faster than Hull in an effort to check a pos sible Nazi eastward push. MT. Roose- welt, according to reliable reports, leans temperamentally toward Bul- lit, but, as a referee, decides more often for Hull on questions of day. to-day strategy,

 How much beyond moral and sympathetic support the United States could extend to Britain and France in event of war would de- pend largely upon official interpre- tation of certain clauses of the neu- trality law. and American public opinion. The neutrality law would automatically bar sale or shipment of manufactured arms, ammunition and implements of war to any bell ligerent. The Johnson act would prohibit France and Britain from obtaining credits here for war supp plies, so long as those two countries were in default on their war debts.

 However, raw materials are not affected by the neutrality law enl- bargo. And credits could be ob- tained by the French and British by expropriating for government use those private credeits and securities owned in this country by their re- spective nationals."

 Win Or Lose An

 (These reports said the offensive would be a win or all or lose all affair; that few troops would be held in reserve and If the Russians, with 6 preponderance of manpow- CT, smashed the drive, 1t probably would mean the defeat also of all the defending forces scattered north to Leningrad.

 CThe Germans might be starting Q pincers movement, one arm of which would try to push into the ] Caucasus from the Kerch peninsula, while the other arm stabbed along the north shore of the Sea of Azov, toward Rostov.

 London observers pointed out that if the Germans succeeded in crossing the Kerch Strait, they would be in the rear of Marshal Tilno- shenko's forces around Rostov, 200 miles to the northeast.

 Military circles in London said they believed the Kerch attack was in considerable force, inasmuch as tho Soviet communique had spectfi- cally mentioned 1t. If 1t really was the first step of an all.out offen- sive, they said the Germans could be expected almost immediately to attack other key points in the Cau- casus and fighting would mount to an unprecedented scale.

 Account of Fighting

 London, May 12- CUP) = Axis armies attempting to start an of- fensive through the Crimea toward the Caucasian oil fields appeared today to have been smashed back at most points with severe losses by what the Berlin radio called num- erically superior"" Red army forces.

 Details of the fighting on the Kerch Peninsula, where Adolf Hit Ter may be trying to launch his long -heralded summer offensive with powerful air support and new weapons"" still were lacking. But the German propaganda broadcasts, which first described the first great offensive operation"" of lS42 as ""in full swing"" later said German military circles were mot inclined to describe this battle for the Kerch Peninsula as the begin. ming of the spring offensive""

 The Berlin radio also complained that the Kerch sector had uncom- lnonly strong fortiAcatlons"" and that the Germans and Rumanians there were facing ""a numerically superior enemy""

 The Nazi propaganda broadcast indicated that the opening move in the offensive on May 8 was a land ing by Axis infantry mad SapperS behind the Russian lines. It made no mention however of what had happeed to the men who made the landing four days ago. thus sug- gesting that nothing further had been heard from them.

 Maxi Made Some Advance

 A British military commentator said the Germans apparently made some progress on the northern part of their front but that elsewhere they seemed to have been smashed back to their original positions.

 The Russian communique, after having told of the offensive earlier, remarked today that nothing of importance developed during the night.

 Dispatches from Mosco, however, said Soviet confidence in victory this year was growing as a result of the increasing strength of the Red army and indications that Ger many's strategic raw materials are rapidly nearing the exhaustion point""

 A new offensive with perhaps l. 100000 Axis troops striking at the Yenikale short cut"" to the Crimea and the middle east and another two or three million holding the still muddy central front against Soviet diversion ofTensives long has been expected. But the British conn mentator pointed out that reports so far did not indicate that massive German forces were being used in the attack on the Kerch Peninsula, although both Berlin and Moscow indicated the importance of the drive by describing 1t in war com- muniques. The NaA high command said the action was ""in full swing""

 Significantly, 1t was pointed out here, the first reports from the crimea suggested change in Ger man tactics, as had been predicted by Allied military sources. There was no indication that Hitler again was attempting the BIitzkrieg methods that were successful in Europe but failed on the vast fronts of Russia.

 Hitler FeEeeA tO Change

 On the contrary, the Red army's success in working out a technique to crush Nazt Panzer attacks with heavy losses appeared to have forced Hitler to fall back on something like a mOdernized version Of the German army methods in the World War,

General Giraud'S appointment Of
Marcel B. Peyrouton to a key post in
French North Africa StirS to new
intensity the complex controversies
which have ragged ever since General
EiSenhOWer'S political arrangement
with Admiral Darlan Immediately
after the landing Of our troops on
African soil.


Monsieur PeyrOutOn becomes not
only Governor General Of Algeria but
also a member Of the Imperial Coun-
Gil, and he is slated to assume ""other
functions"" as well. This indicates
that he will become the virtual head
Of the civil administration, thereby
relieving General Giraud of bureau
cratic tasks for which, as a profess
SiOnal soldier, he does not deem him
self technically qualified Though
remaining the ultimate authority as
High Commissioner, General Giraud
thus will be free to devote himself
more fully to what he has most at
heart, the prosecution of the war
against the Axis alongside General
Eisenhower and the Allied eXpedi-
tiOnary armies.


From a professional angle, Pey-
routon appears we'll qualified for his
job. Over period of years he has
held the highest administrative posts
in all parts of French North Africa,
knows its problems intimately, and
has the reputation of being an able
official. Technically, his appoint
ment is probably the best that could
be made. But PeyrOuton undoubtedly
is man of Vichy."" He was one of
the first to rally behind Marshal
Petain and was entrusted by the
Marshal with the arrest of Pierre
Laval when that arch collaboration
ist with Germany attempted to make
a deal with Hitler behind Petain'S
back in December, 1910 Thereafter
he became Vichy Ambassador to
Argentina, but resigned that post
after Lavals return to power last
year. 1t was from Buenos Aires that
Peyrouton came to North Africa, pre-
Sumably at the suggestion of General
Giraud.


This deliberate importation of
parsonage so identified with the pre-
Laval phase of the Vichy government
has infuriated the Fighting French
Of General De Gaulle and probably
adjournS indefinitely the prospect of
reconciling them with the Giraud
regime. 1t is likewise arousing re-
newed criticism from those circles
in America and Britain which have
opposed from the start political deal
ingS with all former Vichyites who
have rallied to our side. Yet the
Peyrouton appointment unqueStion-
ably has the assent of General Eisen-
hover and Of our State Department.
1t is unthinkable that General
Giraud would have acted without the
previous knowledge and agreement
Of both our representatives in North
Africa and Washington itself. Indeed,
Secretary Of State Cordell Hull has
given unqualified Endorsement to the
actions and policies of General
Eisenhower and Robert Murphy, our
resident Minister to North Africa who
functions as EisenhoWer'S political
adviser and the State Departments
representative. Secretary Hull has
further voiced sharp criticism of
those who condemn our policy in
North Africa with insufficient knoWl-
edge of the ticklish problems in
volved He stressed the seriousness
of the military situation there and
implied that strategic consideration
must take precedence over all else.


Such fortnight statements by the
Secretary Of State should give pause
to those who so caustically criticise
our military and diplomatic leaders.
The American public should have
confidence that those who direct our
war effort, in full possession of the
facts, know what they are doing. The
record thus far shows that our lead
ers have acted wisely and effectively,
At so critical a juncture, carping
condemnation seems SinguIarly out
of place. Our generals and diplomats
should have our faith and confidence
until their competence has been dis
proved by results,"

 It has now been reported by U. s. intelligence services that be- hind this was grim joke played on the British by the Germans. The latter let a British observer, whom they knew to be a spy, see an array of German planes warming up, suppostedly for take-off to London. Information was dropped to this observer that there were 600 of them.

 Naturally, he reported this to London at once - just as the Nazis expected him to do. Result: the British spent sleepless night. So also did U. s. officials in the State end Navy Departments. They had received the same report, relayed from London, and stayed up worrying over it.

 Grimmest part of the joke was that there were only IT anti-air- craft guns to defend the city of London.

 SELL-BIONDI AXIS

 When Italian forces invaded Albania, Germany's genial news man Kurt Sell met Italy's noble neWsman, Count Leone Fumasoni Bondi at a State Department press conference.

 Apparently bewildered over the news, German Sell said to Italian Biondi, ""I don't understand the reason for this invasion. Can you explain it to mel""

 Biondi replied, ""I guess we're trying to initiate you fellows"" WAR HANGS IN BALANCE

 For at least ten days, State De- partment observers have been at a loss to appraise the possibilities of war. This applies to officials at the top as well as those toward the bottom.

 To many, war hung in the bal ance. The belated but prodigious effort of the British to Stop Hit Ter, they felt, might finally stop him.

 To others, however, 1t has seemed that actually war had begun - not the old fashioned war, where troops mobilized and declarations of war were issued, but the modern, streamlined war where government jumps in with lightning moves when the bolt is least expected.

 The swallowing of Czechoslova- kia may have been the first step in such a war, and the invasion of Albania may be equivalent to the Austrian attack upon Serbia in 1914.

 Where the next bolt will strike, no one can predict, but officials are most jittery over three bolts which could be launched at any moment. They are:

 1. An attack by Mussolini on

 the French in Tunis or in

 French Somaliland (Dji-

 boutD.

 2. A squeeze play on Rumania,

 the Hungarians attacking

 from the northwest and the

 Bulgars from the south

 with German support.

 3. A German air attack on

 Great Britain.

 Experts describe the Rome-Ber- lin tactics as those of a boxer-a lead with the left, then blow with the right, and so on. On March IS Hitler led with the in- vasion of Czechoslovakia; Mus solini followed with the invasion of Albania.

 Most official observers believe the two dictators won't stop there, though some hope that Hitler now will be content with merely wear ing down British nerves by fake air raids until next fall, when Chamberlain will be ready for more appeasement.

 ALBANIAN MINISTER

 For the representative of Q small country. few diplomats have cut a more important niche in Washington than Faik Key Kon- itza, minister of the beleaguered government of Albania.

 This is Konitza's 18th year of service in Washington, but that, he maintains, is not the reason for Albania's present luck. Dur ing those 13 years Konitza has be- come renowned for his cooking, respected for his knowledge, and loved for himself.

 Dr. Walker said in part:

 Show me where any of the ""haves,"" the United States, Great Britain, France have shown any willingness to concede trade or territory? Ten years ago few concessions might have saved Germany for democracy. The Allies answered with an iron ring of military and trade alliances. And today we have Hitler! The AL lies goaded and starved the Ger man people into desperation and Hitler seemed to be their only hope. The iron ring is broken now and the zero hour of 8 new world war may strike at any time.

 There are no absolute guarantees for future security in this world. Life at best is a very uncertain thing. If we follow the teaching and example of the Master we plan for the future, we set our faces toward a distant goal, but we do not give ourselves undue anxiety about the morrow's needs. There are some things better left to the Providence of God once we Lave determined to do our duty today. In spite of all our safeguards the material prosperity of this world may elude US.

 think have read that the will of the late Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria Hungary was one of the most elaborate legal documents ever drawn. He was determined to keep intact the royal estate, no matter what might happen. The men who drew the will were asked to provide against every possible contingency, even war, revolution and abdication. These lawyers were the cleverest he could find, they did their level best to carry out the old emperor's wishes. They used their imaginations to such advantage and took pains to make such ample legal provision against all the conceivable turns and twists of future Austrian history that the will seemed as perfect a legal instrument as could be devised. But I think the story was that the will was rendered to all intents null and void within a matter of three years after the emperor's death. These lawyers failed to hedge against imitation. When the bubble of post war imitation burst in Vienna, the imperial estate had been swept away."

 Explosive Zone

 But Hitler and MuSSolini, too, would be moving into a highly ex- plosive zone if they engaged in hos tilities against Russia while con- ducting their war against the Brit ish Empire. Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin all face a quandary and the uncertainties which now exist are beneficial to Britain. Germany's full offensive power cannot be con- centrated against the British. Hit Ter now must hold back heavy re- serves because of the Russian enig- ma.

 Other ways than warfare may be open to Stalin to cause new confu- SionS for Germany and Italy. A revolution in Rumania might be fo- mented, leading to a general Dan- ubian war with Russia urging Bull garia to obtain more of Dobruja than has been awarded her. It has been consistent Russian policy to fish in such troubled waters.

 Too, Russia could give free hand to Turkey, releasing the Turks from their uneasiness over Stalin's dis pleasure if they gave full help to Britain in the middle east. If Stalin were secretly to inform the Turks of his benevolence toward them, it would be blow to totalitarian mili- tary plans involving the eastern Mediterranean and Suez.

 The one certainty of totalitarian intervention in the Balkans is that Hitler and Mussolini have not calm ed the situation there sufficiently to allow themselves to forego further military watchfulness. They must be on constant guard against Com munist craft.

 Germany and Russia have a To- year non-aggression pact. Germany, however, had a similar treaty with Poland and Hitler frequently point ed to it as evidence of his peaceful intentions. So paper agreement is trustworthy between Stalin and Hit Ter. Both know this, as the drift to- ward pre-war enmity, temporarily halted last year, now seems well un- der way, as the consequence of the turn of events in the Balkans."

Groundwork Believed
Already Laid for
Pact Adherence",By the Associated Press.,"


BERLIN, Nov. 21.-Gen. Ion
AntoneScu, Premier of Rumania, ar
rived in Germany today, bringing
his country to the fore as the prob
able next recruit for the expanding
axis alliance.


Accompanied by his foreign min
lister. Prince Costin Sturza. and the
German Minister TO Rumania
Wilhelm Fabricius, the Rumanian
Premier was greeted at the Austrian
border town of Bruck by the Ger
man chief of protocol, Baron Alex
ander Won Doernberg. and other high
Reich officials.


As Gen AntoneScu reached Ger
many, authorized German sources
observed that if the United States
were to go TO war against any one
of the axis powers, not only Hungary,
which Joined the alliance Yesterday.
but all other countries which may
vet join automatically will be at
war with America. Also those Coun-
tries would find themselves at war
with England, it was said.


One authorized commentator added
that adherence to the pact auto
matically means that the axis powers
can move troops through the ad-
herring country.


Emphasis on Solidarity.


This source said. however, that
emphasis is to be laid not on the
military aspects Of the alliance, but
on the moral solidarity of European
nations. which. he said. resent Brit
iSh interference on the continent.


Since Gen. AntoneScu recently
conferred in Rome with Italian
Premier MuSsolini. observers here
presumed that the groundwork al
ready has been prepared for Ru-
mania TO follow Hungary's footsteps
in Joining the l0-year military, po-
htical and economic compact with
Germany, Italy and Japan.

Ciano Returns to Rome.


Count Galeazzo Ciano. Italian
Foreign Minister, returned to Rome
by airplane today from Vienna,
where he witnessed Hungary's ad-
mission to the alliance. Earlier
this week he conferred with Hitler.
Observers viewed Hungary's for
ma, enrolment within the axis as
another step in diplomatic drive
toward the Mediterranean which,
with the addition of other South
eastern European nations might
open an axis highway all the wy TO
the lano frontiers OF Greece and
Turkey.


In this connection it was need
that German troops already are on
Rumanlan soil and that informed
sources have declared that the
visit of King Boris OF Bulgaria to
Hitler las Sunday served the
new political order in Europe""


The possibility that little Slova-
kia, remnant of German-disSolved
CZecho-S -Slovakia. also may sign
up was indicated by the well-con-
nected DienSt aus Deutschland
commentary. which disclosed that
Slovakia's Premier. Prof. Bella
Tuka, is expected shortly in Ber-
lin.


Other Axis Prospects.


In Budapest, also, Rumanla,
Slovakia and Bulgaria were
looked on as prospects for the
spreading alliance. For Ger
man-protected Slovakia and Iron
Guardist Rumania adherence
would be little more than a for
NAL declaration of close Don
with Berlin. For Bulgaria, mem
berShip might provote ambitions
for regaining an Aegean Sea out
let through Greece.


(Turkey, however, took some of
the edge off of axis enthusiasm


in the Balkans by her strong
anti-aXis attitude over Hungary'S
entry into the pact and the as
Sertion of authoritative Turks
that their government would re-
fuse to approve any passage of
German forces through Bulgaria,
even if Turkey were guaranteed
against attack.


IF, as many in the Balkans
fear, the axis diplomatic expan-


sion foreShadoWS a military drive

ater, no big offensive was believed


to be likely before next spring.


Seen Improbable Before Spring.


Informed observers in Bern,
Switzerland, said it was ,improb-
able that two necessities-eff-
cient, swift supply lines through
the Balkans in the east and
Spain's cooperation in the west
could be fulfilled before then.

 Dispatches from the Stockholm Alton Tdningen assert that explo- sions from blockbusters rocked all sections of Berlin but fires provided the worst horrors as storms of clouds of ashes swept through streets often in terrific gusts of flames caused by peculiar effect of bomb blasts and explosions which seemed to create 3 vacuum, followed by a cyclonic wave.

Weak as the New Deal argument is

says, my successor failed, so why should

based on falsehood.


The records show that the United
States had an army of 148,0O0 men in
1888, the year after the New Deal went
into office. The number remained static
until 1887, and even then, after congress
had appropriated funds to increase army
manpower, President Roosevelt did not
budget for the expenditures. And then
Just six months ago-the army chief
of staff told the United States that we
had full equipment for only $4,000 men.


In the face of this record, the New
Deal attempt to blame Republicans for
the nations lack of preparedness seems
silly.


1t seems still more silly to hear the
New Deal talking of 'unpreparedness'
in 1882, because it was not until after
1882 that Adolf Hitler became a major
menace in Europe. Germany's arma-
ments were weak We were as well arm

as to whether this aid could best be

tionary powers to the President was
Senator c. Brooks. Republican of
Illinois, who defeated Democratic
Senator Slattery in the last elec-

Senator Brooks described the

ito take away the responsibilities of
Congress and place them in the
hands of forces that for eight years
have tried constantly, through vari-
Gus other means, to centralize those

He maintained that Great Britain

Representative May, Democrat of

scribed Hitler as IAN international

Brooks repeated the question:

Now is the time to use our in
creasingly superior air strength to
strike hard and continually at the
home front in the Germany from
which so much evil has leaped out
upon the world and which is the
foundation of the whole enormous
German invasion of Russia.


Now, while the German armies
will be bleeding and burning up
their strength against the 1000
mile Russian line and when news
of casualties by the hundreds of
thousands Is streaming back to the
German Reich. Now is the time
to bring home to the German people
the wickedneSS of they rulers by
destroying under their very eyes
the factories and seaports on which
their war effort depends.
Mingles Terrible Threats
With His Winnings.


German propaganda has been
appealing to British public opinion
to put stop to these severe forms
of warfare. -


Herr Hitler himself has not taken
at all kindly to this treatment and
he has been good enough to mingle
terrible threats with his whin-
ingS. sss


Herr Hitler has even called into
question the humanity of these
grim developments of war. What a
pity this conversion did not take
place before he bombed Warsaw or
massacred 10000 Dutch folk in de-
fenSeless Rotterdam or wreaked
his cruel vengeance upon the open
city Of Belgrade.


In those days he used to boast
that for every ton of bombs we
dropped on Germany. he would
drop 10 times or even 100 times
as many on Britain.


But now it is the other way
around. We are in position to carry
into Germany many times the ton
mage of high explosives which he
can send here.


British Bombing Accuracy
Improves With Practice.


The accuracy of our bombing has
nearly doubled, and with continued
practice I expect it will improve
still more.


Moreover, at the same time our
method of dealing with his raiders
over here have more than repaid
the immense care and science be-
slowed upon them and the very
large scale upon which they are
applied.


During April we destroyed about
one-tenth of all raiding aircraft
which aSSailed our island whereas.
acting on a scale several times as
big, the losses we have suffered have
been proportionately far smaller
80 you will remember how German
propaganda films, thinking to ter
rorize neutral countries and glory
ing in their devastating violence,
were wont to show rows of great
German bombers being loaded up
with bombs, then casting showers of
bombs down upon defenseless towns
and villages, choking them in smoke
and flame.


All this was represented to neutral
countries as the German way of
making war All this was intended
to make the world believe resist
ance to German will was impossible
and subjugation and slavery was the
safest and easiest road.


Those days are gone we
have a long list of German cities
in which vital industries of the Ger
man war machine are established
All these it will be our stern duty
to deal with as we have already
dealt with Lubbock, with Rostock,
and half dozen important places.
German Population


Has Way Of Escape


The civil population of Germany
have, however, an easy way of
escape from these seventies. All
they have to do is to leave cities
where munition work is being car
ried on. Abandon their work and
60 out into the fields and watch
the home fires burning from a dis
tance.


In this way they may find time
for meditation and repentance
There they may remember the mil
lions of Russian women and chill
dren they have driven out to perish
in SHOWS and mass executions of
peasantry and prisoners of war
which in varying scales they are
inf1icting upon so many of the
ancient and famous peoples of Eu-
rope.


There they may remember that
it is the villainous Hitlerite regime
which is responsible for dragging
Germany through misery and
slaughter to ultimate ruin. And the
tyrant's overthrow is the first step
to world liberation.


We now wait in what is a stormy
lull, but still q lull before the hurri-
cane bursts again in it's fullest fury
on the Russian front. We cannot
tell when it will begin.


We have not so far seen any evi-
dence OF those great concentrations
OF German masses which usually
precede their large-scale offensive
They may have been successfully
concealed or may not yet have been
launched eastward, but it is now
May 10 and days are passing. We
send our SalutationS to the Rus
sian armies and we hope that the
thousands of tanks and airplanes
which have been carried to their
aid from Britain and America will
be a useful contribution to their
own magnificently developed NUM-
tions resources.

 BLOW YET TO COME His Statement of Present Conditions Failed to Give

 Any Satisfaction",BY WEBB MILLER,"United Press Staff Correspondent)

 London, May 2. - (UP) - Prime Minister Neville Cham berlain today named aggres- sive Winston Churchill to supervise Great Britain's armed force in the war against Germany and called upon an angry, heckling House of Commons to close ranks and ""set our teeth"" in the face of imminent danger that Adolf Hitler will strike again.

 Shouts of ""resigni"" and cries of ""Who missed the Busp"" interrupted Chamberlain as he sought to ex- plain to the House of Commons how Nazi aggression and superior air power had caused the failure of the Allied expeditionary campaign in central Norway.

 That campaign, he contended, still is unfinished, the Norwegian government and King Haakon still are in Norway and the Allied powers will give the Norwegians all the aid possible as rapidly as possible.

 But, he said, the British people apparently fail to realize the danger o fanother German blow, possibly directed against the British Isles, and the Allied leaders will not relax their precautions in other parts of Europe. Then he announced that Churchill, the fiery First Lord of the admiralty, henceforth would have responsibility for supervision of military operations from day to day.

 His announcement and his ex- planation failed to satisfy the op- position and he immediately was assailed by opposition leaders for complacency in the face of ""a re- verse"" and Q ""rebuff"" in Norway. Churchill also was criticized as ""too optimistic""

 Attlee Attacks Him

 Clement R. Attlee, labor leader, opened the counter attack on Chamberlain's explanation, charg- ing the government with having made misleading speeches and said that Chamberlains speech was ""one of excuse and explanation""

 ""The withdrawals from Southern Norway were a rebuff and represent a setback"" Attlee said.

 ""The prime minister's speech of last Thursday was over optimistic and over-complaoement. MT. Chur- chill is far too optimistic.

 We have got to face the facts. This Is @ reverse.

 This, of course, is the ultra pessimistic view, but 1t is held in some high Anglo-Amerioan coun- cils, so cannot be ignored

 The military mind points out that Russia is taking over the Balkans, next Iran, later Turkey all at a time when the western world is tired of war and when the weary American and British people take much the same attitude to- ward these distant areas that they did toward Austria and Czecho- slovakia in 1888.

 But instead of the give em more room-and-they y'll-be-satisfied policy, there is a certain military school of thought which believes the time for showdown is right now

 The military argue that today we are strong, the Russians relatively weak. They argue that we have exactly one year and half of time left. In one year and a half, the Russians will have perfected the atom bomb. Probably they al ready have the secret, but it will take 18 months to set up factories and produce it."

 FINAL FRENCH LESSON Being a devoted friend of France, the United States now is adopting a French lesson even in dealing with France herself; also with her neigh bor Portugal.

 One month ago, after Vichy an- nounced its open alignment with Hitler, Roosevelt prepared to send a message to Congress emphasizing the, importance of the Atlantic is- lands Azores. Cape Verde, Canar- ies) and of French West Africa as jumping off places to South Amer ica.

 Simultaneously seven ships began loading U. s. marines at Quantco, Va, for secret landing on the Azores. The plan was to take these vital stepping stones in mid-Atlantic under the temporary protection of the United States.

 But Roosevelt waited. Also the State Department, being gentle manly, queried the Portuguese Gov ernment. And the Portuguese said they would object strenuously to American Marines on the Azores. They said they would fight.

 So Roosevelt continued waiting Later he referred to the Azores in his fireside chat. and Portugal viz orously protested. Now Portuguese newspapers are whipping up public opinion against the United States.

 At about the same time certain French leaders familiar with Marti- nique informed Washington of their anxiety to cast off from Vichy, come under the protective friendship of the United Stteas. They described the people of Martinique as out of step with Vichy, thoroughly in step with the United States. sThey ,said"

CHICAGO.-It would be foolish to think that
American big business has forgiven or ever
will forgive the harassment which it has been
compelled to endure at the hands of the new
deal since the winter of 1888. These the
men who were called tories and copperheads,
words meaning traitor, who were insulted and
humiliated by inpudent little Shysters sent out
from Washington to administer the Labor Re-
lations act for the benefit of John L. Lewis
and the Communists of the CIO and the racke-
teers of the AFL. Their very bigness in busi-
resS was held to be proof of corruption and
fascism and they were charged with disloyalty
if they believed their country could and should
keep out of the war.


But now, they are the men who are running
the arsenal of democracy and putting to shame
the cheap and venal politics Of Washington,
where thousands of lawyers and party press
agents on the public payroll still carry on the
class war and are trying to renew their jobs
for four years after 1914. They know, as any
one can see, that but for big business dis
tinctive American institution, the United States
would lose this war and that because it is
SO big, the United States cannot lose. They
are satisfied that this time, big business can
not be accused of creating the war and shov-
ing the country into the fight for profits. The
proof of that is found in the very accusation
leveled against them little more than year
ago that they were loath to convert their
plants to war industries because it seemed
a profitless venture.


But forced into war by the enemy, big busi-
ness Is months later, is producing with all
that vast might and ingenuity which the new
deal tried to handcuff and suppress. These
are not new deal achievements, these crates
containing airplane engines which come out
of the plants by the bo-,car load, these tanks,
jeeps and guns and these flying Warships, by
the contribution of those traitorous tories and
copperheads to the destruction of a foe who
challenged country which they love as much
as Harry Hopkins does Felix Frankfurter
or Franklin D. Roosevelt, himself.


And if the Presidents sons are risking their
lives, so are the sons and brothers Of the men

 THE UNION TIMES,

 New Haven, Conn.

 Dear Sir Two weeks ago I was nominated as candidate for alderman representing the ninth ward on the Republican ticket, and, after long and serious consideration I find it neces- sary to decline the nomination for the following reasons:

 As trade unionist and leader ill New Haven and supporter of the pro- gressive youth movement in the city and state for many years, 1 firmly be- lieve that the primary issue of this election is the smashing of Hitler and Hitlerism both here and abroad.

 We must have at this time the unity of all peoples and parties to support the foreign policy of our government i'll giving full aid to the brave peo- pies of Britain, China and the Soviet Union to drive the beast Hitler and his clicque off the face of the earth.

 Since the foreign policy of both the state and local Republican parties is in doubt, therefore decline nomina- tion for alderman in the ninth ward and cannot support them in the com ing election but will support the trade union movement, and aid young peo- pie in gaining extensions of jobs and job training, education, health and recreation.

And the only way to do that is to force the Germans to supply one other major front where fighting is intense.

 That is the grim logic of events. And if this summer brings real danger of Russia cracking, that logis is likely to result in a des- perate yet carefully planned at- tempt to land an expedltionary force on the continent.

The prelude may be a series of Commando raids all along the coasts from Trond- helm to St. NaEaire, bumfuzzlingI the Germans and picking a soft spot.

Every year at this time boys and
girls old enough to work are tempted
to get jobs and keep them. This
year the temptation probably is
greater than ever before, because of
the war and the resulting demand
for even inexperienced help. If you
happen to be wrestling with this
temptation perhaps you will find
the strength to overcome it in this
letter from 15-year-old Powell
Junior High School boy who failed
to graduate with his classmates:


Il fell down on the job for two
reasons. One was sickness. That
I'm not going to mention again
because it was one of those un-
avoidable things. However, the sec
ond reason was that held an after
school job. I let measly So job
hold me back in my school work.


Though I needed the money, I
did not realize that to go to school
would. in the long run. mean a good
deal more money later. I was
throwing my life away for SO a week
I'm sure my life is worth more than
that.


Some fellows quit school to work.
Others, like myself, fail. They, too.
usually quit school eventually. I'm
not going to quit school. I'll make
up the work; III go to summer
school; I'll take the grade over.
But I won't quit.


III need that education the Dis
trict is providing for the postwar
world. That's not far off. I'll have
to take my place in the future
America. 1t is. the patriotic duty
of every American boy and girl to
take advantage Of every educational
facility available to them.


Liberty is holding her torch. She
gets tired, like every one else. She
needs our support. We. the future
America, must give it to her and
we'll need good knowledge to keep
that flame burning brightly. We've
got our schools. Let's take advan-
tage of them!""


Laurel Jean Brown. author of
today's prize winning poem, ""A Sum-
mer Evening"" writes:

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER Il",,"Mingled good and evil are indi- cated in the horoscope for today. While the stars stimulate leaders and encourage sagacity there is a threatening sign for labor.

 HEART AND HOME: This is a favorable date for starting new work or taking new positions The configuration is promising for the home and the family, both of which will be appreciated as never before. Contrast between conditions here and conditions in occupied coun- tries of Europe will be felt by even the least serious Americans. Young men in uniform will carry happy memories and will seek havens of peace in cottages and city dwell lings, wherever the latchstring is out; that should be at every door.

 BUSINESS AFFAIRS: While the world watches each days terrible waste in the World War it is wise to read the stars for forecast of the time when peace is attained. With European cities destroyed, lands devastated and centers of in dustry in ruins it will be the task of the United States to carry. on as the savior of nations. Here fac tories and agriculture, expanded to meet war exigencies, will continue to produce magnificently for end- less needs. Now is the time to look forward with the light of astrology

 NATIONAL ISSUES: Individffal sacrifice will become more and moro necessary from this date, but many selfish persons will question the ur- gency of self-denial in this land of abundance. Campaigns of edu- cation will be carried on by the press and the radio, but subtle fifth column suggestions will have eff feet upon certain minds. Astrolo- gers warn of trend toward ex- travagance among all classes. Prices of luxuries will rise, but there will be large sales of things not nec- essary in a war period.

 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS :. Entrance of Uranus into the sign of Gemini in August will continue to influence warning nations, each violently insisting that it has right on its side New tactics will be ev:- dent in Hitler's campaign. The war of nerves, due to Neptune's influ- |ence, will be less effective for the Axis while the Victory movement gathers influence in Nazi-occupied countries. Gradually a sense of the rights of man will gain among op- pressed victims of Hitler and the seeds of rebellion will germinate rapidly.

 Persons whose birthdate it is have the augury of year of pro- gress financially and nationally. Gains of many sorts will be made by men who serve their country.

 Children born on this day should be fortunate in their life experi- ences. They should be highly intel ligent and personally attractive. Exponents of good will, they have ability to win success.

Europe.


WRUL-World Radio University
Is stepping up the tempo OF It's battle
of the airvaves against the Nazis
in the Spanish and Portuguese
speaking new world, where the Ger
mans have been actively propagan-
dizine against the United States al
most since the day Adolf Hitler rose
to power.


There are nearly 2,000,00o radio
sets in Latin America capable OF
hearing American stations"" Mr..
Lennon said. Since the war began
the Nazis have been able to export
only a few German-made sets to
the Western Hemisphere. The num-
ber of American-made sets Is IN
ereesing.


""The Germans used to sell sets IN
South America manufactured IN
vay to make it impossible for their
users to get any but Nazi statlons
and Nazi propaganda. That day Is
fast passing""


Virtues of Democracy Praised.


With the help of the American
Government, station WRUL gives
course to Latin Americans In the
theory of aviation. 1t teaches the
Morse telegraphic code. 1t conducts
q travel program which acquamts
Latin Americans with the beauty
spots and culture of our cities. IL
provides Latin Americans with SEMI
classical dinner music.


The speakers over the shortWaVe
radio from Boston interlard these
practical programs with direct rel
erences to the virtues OF the demo-
cratic system, which are subjected
to ceaseless attack from the radio
broadcasts out of Germany ar
ranged by Joseph Goebbels.


The station also provides South
America with a weekly summary OF
the American national defense Ell
fort. Mr.. Lennon and his aides
are able to keep abreast OF the Ger
man propaganda trend through the
monitoring of the Axis broadcasts
which the Federal Communications
Commission undertakes.


Mr.. Lennon approaches the work
of his station with the zeal Of a man
with a mission. The seed Of WRUL
was planted at the Versailles Peace
Conference of 1919, which 1t. Lem
mon, U. S. N. attended as President
wilson's radio operator. At Yer
sailles he saw the need for some
method of bringing the peoples OF
the world TO some understanding Of
each other.


A Cultural Weapon.


He dreamed of q radio station
which could serve as university for
the whole earth, and in the middle
i93Os his dream came true. WRUL
was established in Boston, In order
to have it near the great minds OF
Harvard and the Massachusetts, In
stitute of Technology.


When the war began, Mr.. Lem
mon turned his university into Q
cultural weapon for the democracies.
He entered the airwaves fight, d.
recting programs against the Axis
in every continent. Now he Is a
vice president OF the International
Business Machines Corp, as well as
president of WRUL, dividing his
time among New York, Boston and
Washington.


Mr. Lennon thought that teach
ing the English language would go
long way toward developing an un-
derstanding Of this country among
the descendants of the 1berlan
peoples living in Latin America.
Basic English has fundamental
vocabulary of $50 words, to which
are added 200 words to cover the
needs of any particular field.

In Russia the Germans are still on
the run so fast that modern history
knows of no episode with which to
compare this most humiliating flight;
they are abandoning position after po-
sition, and their lines are yielding at
every point along the front from the
farthest north to the Black Sea. There
seems to be no hope of recovering all
the lost territory, so Herr Hitler's
reputed nervousness has a very ade-
quate reason.


And in Libya, the situation is not
a whit better. Here, before the
merciless British fire, Germans and
Italians, more intimately joined in
defeat than ever in victory, are play
ing the game of the hare to such an
extent that there isn't much left of
German or Italian prestige in North
Africa.


No complaint about that situation
has been heard from the American
side of the Atlantic ocean. On the
contrary-there is a huge measure
of satisfaction."

Reporter Sees King.
Twenty-year-old King Michael
and his mother, Queen Helen, re-
ceived me at the country villa where
they are living temporarily and
provided many of the details.
Baron Ion Mocsonyi Styrcea,
youthful and dashing marshal Of
the court and mystery man behind
the scenes, reenacted in the palace
itself some of the events of that
fateful evening. Other officers of
the court and members Of the gov
eminent helped me put details to-
gether while they were still fresh Ia
their minds.


This is the story as they gave It
to me:


No less than seven times, they
said, the king and his young collab-
orators had planned similar coups,
the first early in l942. In most of
these coups the dictator, Marshal
Ion Antonescu, friend of the Axis,
was to have been overthrown. In
two or three 1t was planned that he
should be forced to break with Ger
many. For one reason or another,
all failed, but the circle Of palace
plotters remained intact In spite of
everything the marshal could do to
break 1t up.


Michael Is Central Figure.


The central figure during all this
intrigue. the young king, kept his
young advisers close around him,
meanwhile provoking the German
minister by speaking English to
them, by riding around in an Amer
ican teep, by openly befriending Al

was first set for August rs. But
while preparations were in an early
stage, Baron Styrcea, visiting a doc
tors ONCE at the same time as anl
aide of Antonescu's, overheard aI
telephone call that changed the
plan.


He learned that the marshal was
planning to leave shortly for the
front-where he would be out of
reach. So the date was moved up.


On August % after q late lunch,
Michael sent for Antonescu. He
arrived an hour late, following to
the letter his practice of keeping the
king waiting. He left his bullet
proof automobile, with glass an inch
thick. gift from Hitler, in the
courtyard. Several other automobiles
loaded with bodyguards parked
behind it.


King Awaits Dictator.


The king waited In his comfortable
stucco residence behind the main
palace buildings. He stood in his
study, Gen. Constantin Sanatescu
beside him. Across the hall in an
other chamber sat Styrcea, Gregoire
Nicolescu Buzeti, young diplomat
destined to become foreign minister,
and 20-year-old Mirce Ionnitiu, the
kings secretary and constant COM
panion. In third room an officer
and three members of the kings
own palace battalion stood by.


Through window Michael
watched the hard-featured marshal
-the man who had kept him a vir-
tual prisoner for four years-walk
across the lawn from the palace
When Antonescu came in they shook
hands.


From room across the hall one
of the conspirators-chosen for the
task because his shoes didn't squeak
-tiptoed to a side door to listen.


With the stage thus set, one of
the most important events in Ro-
mania's history took place.


This is what happened Gas re-
ported by Michael HIMSELF:


Michael: 'I have a wire from
the front and the situation looks
disastrous. What are you going to
do about it7 Are you or are you
not going through with the ar
mistice?""


Conditions to Be Met.


Antonescu: YES. I am going
through with 1t, but there are some
conditions to be met. I want O.

will land in Romania and guaran-
tee it for us against the Russians""


Michael: THAT Is so absurd it
is not worth discussing. How do
you expect the Allies to guarantee
Us against their own allies?""


Antonescu: II will not move. II

vania and fight there""

comes, then, so as not to hurt the fine
feelings of the German people, already
deeply wounded by the writings of Lord

by that time by an ever-increasing ac-
cession OF Free Germans"" pseudo
refugees and tourists, is to be conveyed
across to Berlin to protect it from the
unforgettabie indignity of being occu-

their unfortunate fellow Germans, and,
except for a little cleaning-up Of the
early feuds of Strasser g. Co. against

Protestant Prussia by a swarm Of care
fully selected Catholic peasants, nothing
will occur to arouse that deep resent
ment for defeat that, we are assured, is
one of the noblest of German character

But it may be that it is not the At
lantic powers who will get first to Ber-
lin, and it may be that peoples who have
learned at first hand what the German
considers suitable treatment for an in
vaded people will anticipate them.


Strasser's propaganda is incessant. He
writes articles in our advanced journals
upon the decay of morale in Germany
and the necessity of Otto Strasser. This
copy Of 'L'Aigle Prussien Sur L'Alle-
magne"" before me is addressed to one
of them and it is autographed with a
flourish, Homage de Otto Strasser."" ]""
Manifestly he must have supporters in
high places, or he would be disarmed

No comment from me is necessary.
Merely I call attention to the fact that
this is going on while we are in alliance
with Russia, and that Russia is behaving
with the utmost punctilo toward U.s.

Pittsburgh Post Gazette (Repub-

neutrality in strict sense, but the
fact is the overwhelming majority
in this country supports the Presi-

Hartford COurant (Republican) :
Perhaps the President will be able
to steer the Nation on a course that
will enable it to give full material
aid to the Allies without being
finally obliged to give it's men as
well. Yet once neutrality is aban-
doned, few rules are left to guide
either the nation that has given it

is tortuous and unmarked; it runs
into shadows and the end cannot

night.


Details Not Revealed.


The government had not revealed
details OF its plans. and the Sudeten
German party had not indicated
whether it would take less than its
original demands. which included
primarily the recognition Of the Sude-
tens right to profess the Nazi theology.


After the session in the Hradchany
Palace residence Of President Eduard
Benes, the ministers issued this COM
munique:


In a meeting tonight Monday
attended by the president Of the re-
public. the government united upon
definite suggestions which in the next
day or two will be presented to repre-
sentatives Of the Sudeten party


A foreign office spokesman said the
suggestions would be the governments
final concessions.


""All responsible elements OF the gov
ernment are filled with the conviction
that in this European crisis Czecho-
slovakia must demonstrate solidarity
with its allies and is obliged to make
every contribution consistent with the
national honor to uphold peace"" he
said.


The cabinet reviewed the interna-
tional situation and heard reports Of
military developments in France. but
there was no indication whether mill
tary measures were discussed.


Hint Halfway Meeting.


Government circles hinted many of
the Sudetens' eight points were met
halfway. but it was believed demands
that Czechoslovakia abandon alliances
with France and Soviet Russia were
definitely refused 1t was also thought
Czechoslovakia was unwilling to grant
the Sudeten Germans greater voice in
determining military policy.


A well-informed source said Czecho-
slovakia had wanted to reorganize the
state on system of cantons, like Swift
zerland's, so that three alderman dis
tricts would get virtual autonomy.
The Sudeten Germans issued two
communiques. One declared that
only by speedy adoption"" by the gov
ernment of the eight-point autonomy
program ""can the situation be rem
edied."" That was the first party state
ment since Konrad Henlein, the Sude-
ten leader, conferred with Adolf Hitler
last week


The second communique insisted the
government knew the party's position
before Henlein went to see Hitler in
Bavaria. This seemed to be move to
counteract the Czechoslovak argument
that Hitler. and not Henlein, deter
mined the Sudeten Germans stand.


Sudeten German circles expected
Henlein to report again to Hitler be-
fore the Fuehrer discusses foreign af-
fairs at the annual Nazi party con-
gress in Nurnberg, Germany. One YER
sion was that Hitlers mind was not
fully made up about the situation and
that he wanted to learn Czechoslovak
and British reaction to suggestions he
gave Henlein."

This was the posthumous instruction
of Karl Marx, successfully followed by
Lenin in the Russian Revolution. It is
today the ruthless strategy Of Joseph
Stain in expanding the Soviet Unions
domination over Eastern Poland, Es-
tonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with the
prospect that he'will try to extend it to
Finland. Sweden and Norway.


Lenin joined with former enemies to
snatch control of the st. Petersburg gov.
ernment, but when his Bolsheviks had
obtained the upper hand he returned to
his lone-wolf tactics and later annihi-
lated his temporary allies. Stain has
joined Adolf Hitler for the control of
Eastern Europe. How will he treat Hitler
and Germany if he reaches his OBJ
jectives i'll the Baltic countries? Will he
turn then to Russia's neighbors on the
Black Sea, demanding the return of
Bessarabia from Rumania and the con-
troll OF the Dardanelles from Turkey?
Will he attempt to communize the rest
Of Europe? His character, his personal
history, his political philosophy all indi-
cate that the Stain Hitler rapproche-
ment cannot long endure. The entente
will continue as long as Stain finds it
profitable. In the past he has Joined
with others if such a move was to his
advantage; when he could he has
marched separately. distrustful Of all.


Ardent Communists have already
deifled Stain, the son of a peasant cob
bier, as ""the most powerful man on our
planet"" He is the absolute master of
17O,000000 people, courted yet feared by
every government in Europe. He is the
only modern ruler accountable to no one
an overwhelmingly superior position in
present-day politics OF force and threats
of force.


An Enigma Even in Russia.


1t is popular, even in Russia, to call
Stain an enigma. Until the 1917 revo-
luton he was merely one of Lenins
trusted professional revolutionaries,""
and there was time when even the
founder of Bolshevism could not recall
Stains family name of Djugasvili Until
Stain drove Trotsky into exile in 1928
he was barely known to the outside
world except to those Communists who
had learned of his great influence as
general secretary of the Russian party.


At last book has appeared in Eng
ish which strips much of the mystery
from Stain and the Communist move
ment. 1t is Boris Souvarine's Stain""
a 676-page. well-documented but preju-
diced study of the Red Gar of All the
Russias. Despite its bitter bias against
Stain in favor Of Trotsky, it must be ac-
cepted as the most complete single book
in English about the most extraordinary
revolutionary figure of recent times.


Souvarine, a founder of the French
Communist Party and former member
OF the Executive Committee of the Com
munist International, writes with au-
thority, and sometimes with first-hand
knowledge, of the epochal events which
shook the world more than two decades
ago and have placed the implacable
Stain in position where he alone was
able to determine whether the power and





the disposal of its former enemy, Nazi
Germany, or of its new but suspicious
friends, Great Britain and France.


Only Communist could have painted
with such infinite detail the theological
controversies, personal intrigues, intra-
Autobiography battles which led to
Stains subjugation of his associates and
exile or execution of his enemies The
portrait is so gruesome that it defeats its
manifest purpose, particularly when it
derides Stains intellectual powers, gives
him little or no credit for the effective
steps taken to further education among
the masses, and asserts that the 1885
constitution was merely vast diver
sion"" to camouflage the ""atrocious re-
preston"" which was to follow.


Nor is the French writer convincing"

 On April 9 the Office of Price Admin istration announced that motor fuel would be rationed beginning May 15. An unnamed spokesman suggested that the bulk of civilians would be limited to from two to five gallons week. The next day Administrator Ickes and OPA Director Henderson decried this estimate. But when registrars were instructed on which type of ration card to give to motorists, the gauge was based two-to-Six gallons limitation per car.

 Meanwhile reports reached the press on April 24 that, as of May 1, deliveries to filling stations would be cut from two- thirds of normal to half of normal. Ralph K. Davies, MT. Ickes' assistant, denied such step was contemplated. On May the War Production Board, at MT. IckeS' request, ordered the reduction at which Davies had Scoffed.

 This is no isolated incident. It hap pens to be one suitable for discussion be- cause it stands on it's own feet without use of data presumed to be of either use or comfort to Hitler. It is the type of misunderstanding which, if Washington publicity is adequately overhauled, can be cleared up by competent newspaper reporters overnight."

Turning from Norway. he took up
the subject of the Low Country cam
paign. Germany, he said, had few
troops on the Belgian frontier, while
large concentrations of French
tanks and troops showed France was
preparing to move against Germany
through Belgium.


There was such q concentration
Of signs pointing to a movement OF
French and British troops through
Belgium and Holland that I dis

don and Paris showed the British

early in May, he said. and so Il
gave orders to attack"" on May 10.


He said the startegy of the Allies
including their concentration of
troops, made the German task

plan OF operations which ultimately
was carried out.


Paying tribute again to the Ger
man soldiers, he said the soldiers OF
the new provinces taken into the
Reich showed equal valor and thus
helped make possible ""the glorious
victory""


""The command of the new Ger

considered much better than the
command of yesterday""

attack to occupy Holland and
to march against Antwerp""


Here again he detailed the move

north and south. It was evident,
he said, that success of the oper-
ations would mean the complete
defeat Of the British and French
forces in Northern France.

James F. Reilly, defense attorney,
told the jury of two women and 10
men that, in carrying on what the
Government called pro- German
propaganda, Miss ingalls, had done
no more than many eminent Ameri-
cans had been doing at the time.
Members of Congress and others op-
posed to war, he pointed out, had
been saying the same things on plat
forms all over the country that the
aviatrix had said, and she was con-
cerned primarily with keeping this
country at peace.


""Bit Of . Crackpot.""


Declaring that Miss ingalls, record
showed her to be a woman of ""cour-
age, ambition and a tremendous
amount Of egotism,"" the defense at
torney added:


""She also has shown herself to be
a bit of a crackpot. In fact. this
woman is a fanatic in carrying out
what she believes""


Mr.. Reilly charged the r. B. I.
with keeping Miss ingalls, under
interrogation steadily for ""A hours
without sleep. While the Govern
ment, he added, had ridiculed her
claim to have been a one-person
nter-espionage service, she al
ways has done things alone, he
pointed out. He cited her long
flight over the Andes, the first
woman to achieve that.


Speaking of Miss ingalls, ad-
mitted statements expressing ad-
miration for what Hitler had done
for the German people. Mr.. Reilly
said:


""A lot Of people Of Irish blood
think that Hitler Is no worse than
Cromwell war""


A Mata Hari. She Says.


The noted flyer was on the witness
stand most of yesterdays session,
and she insisted vehemently that,
although she was on the payroll OF
the German Embassy for 81 days,
her only motive was to obtain con-
fidential information which might
be of service to the United States
Government in its effort to thwart
spies and subversive elements.


Il saw myself as Mata Hari,""
said Miss ingalls,. LAS an interna-
tional spy, let us say""


Miss ingalls, earlier had described
herself, in letters and on the stand,
as 'incurably romantic"" She
pointed to her adventurous career as
an aviatrix, which during II years
had brought her many exciting ex-
periences and enabled her to hang
up a number Of records.


The flyer conceded, during her
testimony, that some of the anti
British assertions in correspondence
presented by the Government rep
resented her actual views at the
time, although these sentiments had
been emphasized to convince the
German Embassy official with whom
she was In contact.


Wanted u. S. to Shun War.


Referring to several letters to
Hans Thomson, then Charge DAT
faires of the German Embassy, con-
tanning violent attacks on Britain
and exultation at German victories,
Miss ingalls, said:


THAT was the way I felt at the
time. I didn't want to see us get
into this war. AL my friends were
pro-British and there was nothing
I could do about it. And I wanted
to impress DR.. Thomson that I was
sincerely interested in the German
cause""


The flyer admitted she had quoted
Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" In some of
her speeches, explaining: HE was
feeding fire to the German people
I thought it was better to feed fire
to the American people If we were
to defend ourselves""


She said she also had quoted
Churchill, Lincoln, Emerson and
Nietzsche in her speeches for the
America First Committee."

 The diplomatic effects already were visible in one key capital Tokyo. The Japanese third-partner in the Berlin Rome Tokyo triangle were depressed and disheartened by the event. They had regarded Hess as one of their special friends in Berlin and could not understand why he should have wanted to es- cape from Germany to Britain.

 Light May Come

 Some light may be cast on the mystery after the British have completed their extensive question: Ing of Hess, now underway under the leadership of Tvone Kirkpatrick, a foreign office expert who is c per- sonal friend of the Nazi leader. It was suggested that Churchill may make a statement on the case ct an early date. 4r

 On the war front the night was marked by 0 sharp reduction In German Air attacks on Britain. The Royal Air Force bombed Mann helm, Cologne, Coblenz, Ostend and Dunkirk. North Africa was quiet and there was little action in 1raq.

 There was trouble in Shanghai where U. s. marines were called out after 0 battle between settlement police and pro-japanese Chinese police in which an American and nine others were wounded.

 The British Admiralty reported that shipping losses since start of the war have been 6,l27,67 tons, an average of 3o6,3s4 per month. For the last year losses have been 4,- 734,407, an average of 394,634 per month. The Admiralty figures were up 49,343 tons over those an- flounced only Saturday by the inin- istry of information for the same period.

 Something Unreal

 Some weight was lent this hypo- thesis by the statement in Berlin of the semi-ofiicial Nazl organ, National Socialist Korrespondenz, which asserted that papers left be- hind by Hess indicated he believed that-""owing to previous personal contacts""--he could reach an un- derstanding with the British.

 In the background there was an- other factor lending additional cred- ibility to this strange possibility.

 That is the fact that Hitler seemed by hints seeping through from several European capitals-to be engaged at the moment in Q mighty new effort to achieve his long, sought objective of e united ,or- ganized new order"" In Europe.

 This Nazi ambition has been at- tempted, 1t Is believed, before notably last autumn. But at that time Germany found 1t impossible to bring Spain and the Vichy regime of France into the united order which was designed to con. front Britain with amalgamated Europe dominated by the NazI hierarchy."

 A third threat is to the northern supply ports of Murmansk and Archangel. The recent conferences between Hitler and Baron Manner helm of Finland were interpreted by Allied sources as a probable prelude to drive in the Arctic.

The theological purists, however,

man who for two years appeared to
follow the Nazi theology. They see
in the acceptance of Darlan into
the American fold a dangerous
precedent and are asking fearfully

Franco himself.

they are not in a position to look

start giving political ""Wasserman

tribute to the winning of the war.
They point out further that Russia,
one of our staunchest allies today,
was the ally of Herr Hitler less
than two years ago.


If Gen. Eisenhower had insisted
on keeping Darlan under two

certifying him as loyal, then the

 Washington, Feb. 21-(UP)--Unit- ed States foreign policy, based pri- marily on low-tariff economies and good neighbor' relationships but dominated just now by big navy defense program, stands unchanged today by spectacular European poli- tical events. Officials did not care to comment beyond that on the biz diplomatic week end.

 Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitlers re- statement of Nazi expansion aims should not, however, have surprised the state department in view of re- ports understood to have been sub- mitted by William E. Dodd before he resigned as United States ambas- sador to Germany.

 Dodd's reports, possibly discounted by the state department because of his anti-Nazi sympathieS, are be- lieved to have fixed the limits of Hitler,s European ambitions consid- erably beyond the scope of Der Feuhrer's address yesterday to the Reichstag in Berlin.

Tunisia and Stalingrad


Great German Disasters.


This toll was taken by the Allied
air force and by the British subms
rines, cruisers, destroyers and motor
torpedo boats.


This British naval force at the
same time caused an impassab BILE
barrier between the enemy in Tunisia
and all prospects of escape. During
the latter phases the fixed patrol was
| maintained in force which would
have prevented any attempt at
escape except by individuals.


In fact, believe only 638 persons
have escaped, and these, for most
part, by air on this scene of
surrender.


One cannot doubt that both Stall
1ngrad and Tunisia are the greatest
military disasters that have ever
befallen Germany in all the wars she
has made, and they are many.


There Is no doubt from the state
ments Of captured generals that
Hitler expected his Tunisian army
to hold out at least till August and
that this was the view and intention
OF the German high command


The suddenness Of the COLLAPSE of
these great numbers of brave and
skillful fighting men, with every
form of excellent equipment, must be
regarded as significant and in a
sense characteristic OF the German
psychology. which was shown after
Jena and also at the very end of the
last war.


Though this fact should certainly
be noted and weighed, no undue ex-
pectations should be based upon it.
We are prepared to win this war by
hard lighting and if necessary by
hard fighting alone.


In years Of peace peoples of the
British Commonwealth and those of
the United States were an easy
going folk, wishing to live a free
life, with active politics and other
opportunities of innocent diversion
and OF national self-improvement.


They do not covet anything from
others, perhaps because they have
enough themselves. and they have
even failed to keep a good lookout
upon their own safety.

current peace talk.


Hitler's intensiflcation OF the
drive against Moscow and in the
Caucasus, his preparation for a
new battle for the Mediterranean,
both via Spain and North Africa,
his intense activities in Libya,
are made as much for political
as for military reasons, and they
are as much directed at WASH

can not afford it. He is late in

that the war will be long one.
and he must Immediately
strengthen his ties to his allies
by military successes, cost what
they may.


Japan Loses Either Way.


In all this. Japan's position is
the least enviable. For Japan,
having started on campaign of
conquest for which she was neith-
er politically nor economically
strong enough, either must enter
the world war, or get out of it
altogether, and in either case
she stands to lose the worst OF
any one. For if she refuses the
American offer she will be the
first 20 receive the impact OF
American Intervention. She will,
thereby, perform an immense
service to Hitler at immense cost
to herself.


The gains for the Axis from
such intervention will be made
in Africa, not in the Pacific. Hit
Ter knows that If Japan enters
the war, Japan is lost. But by
Japan's altruistic ra-kiri,
American material will be de-
flected to the Far East, rather
than to Russia and Britain, and
that is all Hitler wants.


Japan, of course. would like
Hitler to win the war for Japan
AS Mussolini hoped he would
win it for Italy. Japan would
like to wait, choosing exactly the
most favorable moment to come
in. Hitler, on the other hand,
wants Japan to win the war for
him-at the cost of her own de-
feat. That is what Germany
means by an alliance. The
United States wants peace with
Japan, and the concentration of
all energies against Hitler.


This would be on all counts
the best course for Japan to fol-
low. Through it she could win
peace in the Pacific, the economic
collaboration of the United States
now and after the war, and neu-
trality in the gigantic struggle
in which, if she enters it, she
will be the weakest Axis partici-
pant ranged against the strong
est anti-Axis power.


Loses More BY War.


But Japan has gotten herself
into a position in which she sim
ply can't win. She will lose on
any count. She will lose inf
nitely more by war than by
peace. She will lose no matter"

blissful complaisance between Sep

much wishful thinking that the

Many and weird were the

the discomfort of shrunken stom-

Mussolini to end an unpopular

AS was true in regard to the re-
peal Of the Arms Embargo, and the
Selective Training and Service Act,
and in fact the whole defense
program, deliberate effort is being
made to deceive the American people
concerning the nature and conse-
quence of these measures.


1t is being claimed that this meas
ure sets up dictatorship in the
United States because it confers
upon the Chief Executive the power
to manufacture and to distribute
these defense weapons 10 nations
whose defense he may regard as
vital to our own defense. The
charge of dictatorship is the one
which is usually made by those who
seek to frighten the people or to
offer some spurious argument in
the lack of arguments grounded in
reason and in logic. So insistent
has this charge of dictator become
that we might be justified in be-
lieving that some of those who urge
it would prefer that our liberties
be permanently surrendered at the
behest of a foreign dictator than
to surrender temporarily to the
Chief Executive the power to exercise
authority in the face of a great
emergency.

authority with dispatch and effec-
tiveness, born of the necessity from
day to day.


1t is being urged against this
measure that it will lead us into
war; that it is a violation of inter-
national law; that the exercise of
the authority under it will be an act
of war which will lead us inevitably
into this European conflict. I have

Claimed by Chicago o
New Deal Leaders",BY JAY FRANKLIN.,"In the last few days. the Willkie
trend in the Midwest seems to have
been checked, while Roosevelts
strength is growing, according to,
reports to New Deal leaders in
Chicago.


A single evening saw a sharp set
back to the Willkie-Lewis drive to
link the c. I. o. with big business
in an ""unholy alliance"" which is
being compared by some TO the
Hitler-Stalin pact Of August, 1899.
On that night, there was a big labor
meeting for Mayor La Guardia at
the West Side Stadium, where
10000 Chicagoans were packed in
and an additional $4,000 crowded
outside the doors. A week before,
bare 1000 had turned out to hear
Dan Tobin and Secretary Ickes.


At this meeting, the crowd
cheered as labor leader after labor
leader-Whitney of the railway
brotherhoods. Thomas of the United
Automobile Workers &C. I. o., and
representatives Of the A. F. of L.
Joined in support of President
Roosevelt and labor unity. Mayor
La Guardia brought the house down
with a rough-and-tumble attack on
Wendell Willkie. Melvyn Douglas
of Hollywood also spoke effectively,
and the net effect was TO step up
the morale Of the Democratic forces.


Kennedy's Speech Effective.


The same evening, Ambassador
Kennedy broke the hearts of the
pro-Willkie faction in this region
by his announced support of Mr..
Roosevelt, when the buildup had
led them to hope Mr. Kennedy
would take a walk. The Kennedy
speech was particularly effective in
Irish-Catholic circles and among
those business groups where the
Ambassador is regarded as one Of
the shreWdest oportunists in Ameri-
can history. If Joe Kennedy comes
out right down the line for F. D. R.,
they interpret it as meaning that
he figures that Roosevelt will win,
that England will win, and that
the axis, at home and abroad, is
on the way out.


Dorothy Thompson's broadcast,
taking John L. Lewis to pieces on
his 'unholy alliance"" was described
as ""the most effective speech of the
campaign"" by man with 40 years
experience in Illinois politics. The
bank at Englewood, Ill, which was
used as an illustration Of unfair Re-
publican campaign tactics by Mayor
La Guardia, found itself facing
angry depositors the following day.
The steel workers and the packing
house workers in this region have

New Deal Seen on Upgrade.


Every speech by Mr.. Roosevelt in
creases morale and is winning votes,
and the Democratic organization is
cruising through the Loop with
the Republican Navy""-a dinghy
manned by Martin, Barton and Fish.


For the first time since the Juror
over Elliott Roosevelt's captaincy,
Democratic and New Deal sentiment
has hit the upgrade. Current polls
of newspaper opinion are said to
miss much of the latent Roosevelt
strength, because the full-time fac
tory employment-With many mills
running on a 24-hour basis-keeps
the workers of the streets, while
employer coercion makes many
workers reluctant to advise can
vassers as to the true state Of their
sentiments.


One man recently was fired from
a large oil company here after he
had refused to wear a Willkie but
ton. Down-State and farm senti-
ment seems pretty evenly divided,
which means that the Chicago vote
should carry the State.


This new wave of Roosevelt
enthusiasm is spreading from Chi
cago and affecting all of this indus
trial AREAS far West as Min
neapolis, up into Wisconsin and
Michigan, and far over into Indiana
and Ohio. Until this development,
Wisconsin was regarded as lost to
the Republicans, with Michigan.
Ohio and Indiana a $3.50 chance
and Illinois too close for comfort.


If the events of the last ""A hours
are any indication. this decisive area
in national politics will be found in
the Roosevelt column on Noven-
Der 5.


incidentally, the fact that the first
man called for the draft in Chicago
was Chinese has tremendously
eased the tension over the drawing
of numbers at Washington.

United Press Staff Correspondent","PARIS, Nov. IL. (UP),-Ger-
many's demand for return of pre-
war colonies is deemed of greater
concern to France from a politi-
cal and military viewpoint than
economically.


When the World war ended and
the victorious Allies split up Ger
many's overseas empire of more
than a million square miles,
France did not reap any out
standing economic gains. 1t got
! two-thirds of Togolahd (the only
German pre-war colony which paid
its own way) and about four
tifths of the Cameroons.


As German West African pos
sessions, the Cameroons had
about $4,000 square miles area
and Togoland $4,000 square
miles. If the Third Reich regain
ed al lor part of these areas,
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler would have
a foothold in Africa on which ne
might develop important subma-
rine and aviation bases that would
worry both Britain and France
and would be less than 5000
miles from South America.


From practical standpoint,
Frances colonial wealth lies in
colonies other than those taken
from Germany. Morocco, Tunisia,
Algeria, Indo-China and New Cal
edonia provide mineral and agri-
cultural wealth and furnish mar
kets for many millions of dollars
worth Of French industrial ex-
ports annually.


The former German colonies
now held by France under League
of Nations mandate, their back
ground and Importance arc shown
in the following: g.. ..


CAMEROONS ...h


French and English forces cap
tured CAMERON from the Ger
mans in 1915 and, after the peace
treaty, they divided the territory.
France took 154,444 square miles,
including an area which had been
ceded to Germany by France in
1911 from the French Congo in
settlement of Germany's recogni-
ton of Frances grab of territory
in. Morocco.


The, Cameroons would provide
a foothald for Germany on the
West African coast. They extend
inland to Lake Tchad, in the heart
of the continent and at the seuIce
of water supply for much of the
interior. In this connection, Pre-
mier Renito,. ,Mussolini has been
seeking further cession : of
French Sahara to Italy to extend
the southern borders of Libya to
Lake Tchad.


If the aims of the Nazi-Fascist
powers in this direction were real
lied, they would have a strip
through the heart of Africa ex-
tending northWard to Libya, thru
Italy and Germany right to the
North Sea. Even if the Mediter-
ranean sea were corked up at
both ends in event of an emer-
gency, the German-Italian combi-
nation would have an overland
outlet to the Atlantic ocean.


France, while expecting a solu-
ton of the German colonial de-
mands, does not expect any such
settlement as that to be made, al
though. part of the Cameroons
eventually may be returned to the
Reich. There are two seaports,
Douala and Kibri, in the territory"

ALLENTOWN, Pa, May 30
House Speaker Sam Rayburn de-
clared tonight that there seemed te
be ""a studied effort to destroy the
faith and confidence Of the Ameri-
can people"" in Congress. He spoke
at the bi-centennial celebration al
Muhlenberg College Of the landing
in this country of Henry Melchiel
Muhlenberg.


The Speaker said that Mullen.
berg, organizer of the Lutheran
Church in America, headed a fam.
lily which had given many distin-
guished sons and daughters to the
country. Among them was Fred
erick Augustus Muhlenberg, first
Speaker of the House of Represen-
tatives. Mr.. Rayburn praised his
services to the House and to the
country.


Even back in those days when
Mr.. Muhlenberg was the first
Speaker"" said Speaker Rayburn
""he and the members of the House
were attacked just as they are to-
day. In every great crisis in any
nations history, the men who are
doing the worlds great work are
attacked. The members of Con-
gress are today under attack.


Congress Has Done Duty.


""The present Congress cannot run
this war, but is has done its duty
It has given the administration
every law and every dollar it ha!
asked for to prepare the country
for defense.


Some people, wanting to attack
some group in Congress for a vote
they have cast, seem to think they
must attack the body as whole
But a majority of the members OF
the Senate and House constitute the
Congress and when this majority
acts, it's actions are law when the
Presidents signature is attached.


""A great many people cry out
against relationships. There has
never been a dictatorship built up
in any land until the faith and con-
fidence of the people have been
destroyed in the legislative branch
itself had been destroyed. Take the
history of the world from the Cae-
sars to now, and you will find this
to be true.


Hitler did this first in his own
land, and then in the conquered
countries of Europe by propagan-
dists, and unfortunately quite a few
commentators, and speakers and
writers, without thought of the con-
sequences and without knowledge
of what is being done, are carrying
on or spreading this propaganda.


Says Job Is Being Done.


""Just few months ago you heard
such propaganda as this: That
nothing was being done by Con-
gress or the administration; that
the industries were lying down on
the job: that labor was not doing
its part


Speaker Rayburn gave these re-
ports the lie. declaring that Gov
6TI1Il6IlU Ill dll lCS QCpdl tlllCliOo, Ill
dustry and labor are doing ""a great

Hitler, in ""Mein Kampf,"" Speaker
Rayburn said, had suggested that If
it is desired to spread disunion in a
country or a people, all that is
necessary is Ito tell big enough
lie"" and to tell it often. He indi-
Gated that is what is being tried out
by the propagandists in this country
today.

ence that this country would have

The diplomatic sensation sprung
In Moscow eleven days ago has been
intensified by the overturn in Italy
which occurred four days later. 1t
was on Wednesday, July 81, that
Pravda, the official organ of the
Russian Communist party. gave a
full-page spread to manifesto by
an organization styling itself the
Free German National Committee,
warning its compatriots that the war
was lost for them, that prolonged re-
sistance would spell the doom of Ger
many and that the only way to avert
that fate was to rise in revolt, over
throw Hitler and set up a revolu-
tionary regime. By such action, de-
clared the manifesto, the German
people would win the right to
decide their fate themselves. In this
manner it will attain peace and once
again place Germany on an equal
footing with other nations"" The
manifesto was signed by a list of
names ranging from obscure war
prisoners to German Communist
leaders who fed to Russia when Hit
Ter came to power decade ago, the
most prominent being Wilhelm PECK,
former Communist party whip in the
Reichstag and subsequently secre-
tary of the Comintern until its dis
solution two months ago.


Although the Moscow authorities
pointed out to resident foreign cor
respondents that the Soviet govern
ment was not committed to, the pro-
gram outlined In the manifesto of
committee which had not been Of
ficially recognized, the event has
been generally interpreted abroad as
bearing Soviet approval and probably
Soviet inspiration. Pravda is unqueS-
tionably the mouthpiece of the Rus
sian Communist party and It's head,
Joseph Stain 1t is unlikely that such
a document would appear in Pravda
without Mr.. Stalin's appreciation.
Furthermore, the manifesto was re-
published in the Russian press gen.
orally, was broadcast repeatedly over
the Russian radio and was dropped in
leaf1et form by Soviet Army flyers
over the German lines on the eastern
front. The conclusion seems ines
capable that this official publicity
buildup denotes a well-conSidered
move in Russian foreign policy


Now this move was made suddenly,
and, as far as known, with no pre-
vious notice to Soviet Russia's Allies
and associates This is what invests
it with disquieting significance. Fur
thermore, it should be evaluated
against a background of consist
emily independent diplomatic atti-
tude. Stain has never formally
associated himself with the ""uncon-
ditional surrender formula laid
down last winter at Casablanca by
President Roosevelt and Prime Min
ister Churchill, has avoided joint
conferences with them and has more
than once evinced standpoint
similar to that in the recent mani
festo, notably in a pronouncement
on November 7 of last year, when
Stain stated that Russia was not
aiming at the destruction of the
German nation or even the German
Army, but merely at the destruction
of Hitler and the Nazi regime. From
all this, the logical inference is that
a revolutionary overturn in Germany
might expect a more benevolent
attitude from Moscow than from
London or Washington.


The matter acquires heightened
significance from what is happening
in Italy. At a moment when the
Axis is shattered and the satellite or
occupied countries are seething with
diSaffection, multitudes of Germans
must see in the possibility Of
softer"" peace on the terms described
in Pravda and previously indicated
by Stain himself the best way out
of an increasingly hopeless situa-
ton. Indeed. current advices from
Sweden describe revolutionary stir
rings in Berlin itself, significantly
started by italian workingmen there,
who form part of vast Italian labor
force scattered throughout the Reich.


Obviously, we stand on the thresh-
old of tremendous events. There is
a distinct likelihood that not merely
Italy but also Germany and the rest
Of sdominated Europe may flare
into radical revolution which will
look toward Moscow rather than to-
ward London or Washington. And
there is apparently no present un-
derstanding between the three capi-
tails as to how such an eventuality
would be handled."

 2. Whether Poland, knowing that neither Great Britain nor France could render her effective military aid, would nevertheless decide to fight if Germany attacked. Crush Poland Quickly

 It was learned that the German general staff estimated that it could completely crush Poland within two ol three eeks by simultaneous thrusts from the south through Slo- vakia, from the southwest through ! Silesia, and from the west from Pomerania.

 If the words and the grim tenn per of the British people mean any thing Britain will fight if Poland resistS on a We scale.

 aroused by activities of potential Fifth Columnists.

 Perhaps the most famous spy ! thriller cracked by a tip from a civilian was the famo $ Duquesne espionage case in which B NaZi agents were apprehended and con- victed. For some time during the investigation, the FBI sought to identify one Heinrich who was furnishing to Lily Stein, fellow spy, information on U. s. aircraft production.

 It was an observant Connecticut photographer who supplied the missing clew. Noticing that one Edmund c. Heine had placed an unusually large order for photo graphs, and had asked many ques- tions about the area. the photog- rapher passed on his information to the FBI. With this clew, the G. men clamped down on Heine and were able to identify him as the mysterious Heinrich. His sentence was IS years plus fine of 5000.

 Ernest Frederick Lehm1rz and Erwin Harry De Spretter, the two Staten Island spies convicted last summer, were both tipped off to the FBI by civilian reports. Lehmitz came to the United States in March 1941, aboard the Siboney. On the voyage across, his actions had aroused the suspicious of an alert fellow Reporting his sus- picions to the FBI, he set in motion a long and painstaking investiga- tion which finally resulted in the apprehension of NaI spy who had been trained in Germany in the preparation of secret writing and schooled in the type of information valuable to the German high con- mand

 De Spretter had the FBI put on his trail from simple report from a civilian that the man was strongly pro-NaI in his sympathies, indicating for the first time that he might be engaged in activities 1n- imical to the national security. It was more than a year later, how ever, before the G-men were able to check his record and gather the evidence that led to his conviction. Both Lehmitz and De Spretter were sentenced to 30 years.

 It was New Workers tip that helped clinch the case against Ro- berto Lanas Vallencilla, a Colum- bian employed in the offices of the Coordinator of Inter-American Af- fairs in Washington. Lanas Val lencilla recently confessed to com- munications with the NaziS, after his arrest by the FBI.

Of course, You can write if dowr

will redouble his attempts to inject
honesty into the labor movement
and it will result in more readers
for him. The guy won the Pulitzer

himself. The unionists will continuA

Pegler is hampering the war effort
by fumigating the unions and j;
therefore a fifth columnist"" az

ing to plaster an unpleasant phrase
on the opposition. 1t would be na.
tural, for Pegler has been sockng
the communists right and left both

What is a fifth columnist? To me
it means guys like Ham Fish and

Martin Laval Sweeney who were
so busy with their hates Of our

would help Hitler and the Japs BE-
cause it would hurt Roosevelt, 1t
means Bundists and United Mothers.
Beneath Contempt


1t would be beneath contempt for
Pegler himself to answer such
phrase, but I can do it for him, The
fact is that no American writer has
so bitterly and regularly denounced
and Scorned Hitler and MuSsOln
and the Japs and their several
forms of fascism. Pegler started Il
years before the war. He started
after he Travelled through Europe
and saw the Brown Shirts in action

They are doing things which

 Bulgaria is important in the Nazi scheme only because of it's geographical position. It has been under complete German domination for months Its people, like all Balkan Savs, are strongly aware of their racial affinity with the Russians. Con- munism is a name that has meaning to them. They have given many indications of their dis pleasure with the Nazi attack on Russia and as consequence the German overords have imprisoned thousands of Bulgarans.

 It is the king, the cabinet and the general staff, not the people, that the Germans seek to tie more securely to their chariot in this endeavor to make Bulgaria belligerent. As they hold out glittering promises to Tsar Boris. He can have absolute naval command of the Black Sea. He has no navy now but Italy may furnish it. He can have undsputed trading rights in that area and also a protectorate over the Crmea. The mild appearing Tsar Boris is a great schemer. He is ambitious. He has survived many uprisings against his rule, both popular and military. The lure is one he cannot resist He will do Germanys bidding in this as meekly he allowed the Wehrmacht to come into his country last spring.

 Bulgaria, therefore, will be asked to join Ger many in drive toward the Dardanelles. An effort will be made to resurrect Bulgar Turkish enmities from the last century when the Sultan ruled Bull gara At the appropriate time the Thracian border of European Turkey will blaze The Germans seem impervous to the fact that Bulgaria may blaze in formally too have other occupied countries. Their indifference to this possibility is confession that they are hard pressed in Russia.

 This move will be coupled with pressure at An kara Dr. Karl Clodius, German trade missionary, whose name spells disaster for every country he visits is now in the Turkish capital trying to im- plement the German-Turkish trade treaty. At the same time Franz von Papen, Hitler's envoy to An kara, and Hans Rhode military attache, are in Berlin detailing what progress they have made in boring from within.

 Turkeys time has come. In the one-by-one method of the Germans the frontiers of the non- belgerent neutral Turkey have been reached. Tur- key most likely will remain free of German troops. Hitler's armies could not advance across Anatolia toward the Caucasus while Allied armies are sta- toned along the Syrian, Iraqan and Iranian from tiers of Turkey ready to strike. What Is sought Is the diplomatic imprisonment of Turkey There would be no fear that Turkey would observe the terms of the Montreux Treaty governing the Dar- daneles or honor her treaty of friendship with Britain drive by well land could be made for the Baku oil fields German armies in the southern Ukraine could be supported with sup plies and endorsements by sea much more easily than is possible by land.

 The real decision in this development lies in Ankara, not Sofia Allied diplomacy of the most skifu sort is called for. If Turkey deserts-and her loyalty has been none too sure in the past the Allied supply route to southern Russia is en- dangered; the position in the Near East and North Africa is made precarious and greater burden in defeating Hitler is laid upon the Allies and the United States."

Holds Against Huge Odds Till U. S. Comes In


MarQuis",,"Looking back on the smashing sue
cesses in Egypt and Libya, the British
are justly proud of the record of their
navy, which in large part made those
achievements possible. The victories
have served to point up not only the
prelude to the defeat of Rommel, which
was the sending of vast amount of
war material over many thousands of
miles of sea, but the long and perilous
task OF the British Navy in guarding
the ocean routes of the world for, more
than three years.


For more than two years of that time
the British did the job alone, aided only
by such equipment as we could spare,
including, of course, the all-important
transfer of so old destroyers. British
ships and British seamen held the line
against seemingly inSuperable obstacles.
And in doing so they hung up records
which are likely to stand for long time.


Ocean conveys, according to recent
statement of Vice Admiral Wake Walker,
have totaled 1875, 100000 miles, the equiv
alent of 5000 times around the world
More than 10000 conveys have been
escorted, in which 1879 out of every 200
vessels have reached port safely, accord
ing to figures provided by an authorita-
tive source.


600 Ships at Sea.


Britain has constantly at sea 600 war
ships and auxiliaries. In the Atlantic
alone 250000 men of the Royal Navy are
serving. The Admiralty patrols, with
varying degrees of watchfulness, 10000
miles of trade routes on which sail 1000
British and Allied merchantmen.


But mere figures do not tell the real
story. The epic has been written in the
individual narratives of the ships them
selves and of the unsung heroes who
man them. There is nothing conSpicu-
ously heroic in sweating for an 18-hour
watch in the engine room of a destroyer
Such men, thousands of them, have
made it possible for the British Navy to
maintain control of the seven seas.


Take, for example, the record of the
battleship H. M. S. Rodney. Since the
beginning of the war the Rodney, COM
manded by Capt. J. w. Rivett-C Carnac,
has steamed more than 10000 miles
For 30 out of the first SO months after
September, 1899, she has been at her

H. M. S. Rodney was one of the war
ships in on the kill of the NaN super
battleship Bismarck. The machinery Of
the 17-year old vessel was known at the
time to be badly in need Of repairs, yet
she steamed at full speed for 18 hours.
For keeping the ship going at high speed
when she should have been limping
home for repairs, the engineer officer in
charge was given the Distinguished
Service Order.


Just before the pursuit of the Bis
marck began in the North Atlantic the
Rodney was escorting a convoy. Boiler
trouble developed and the engineer in
charge shut down the defective boiler.
Then he and an engineroom assistant
climbed into the furnace to make tern-
porary repairs. The heat was such that
they could stand it for only five minutes
at time and when the job was COM
pleted they were pulled out exhausted.
But they had done in four and a half

and are fully aware that, II feasible,

on the way last August.


: The Soviet forces were in a much
stronger position then than they are
today.


Molotoff Given Full Facts.


Foreign Commissar Molotoff was
given the full facts when he was in
Washington a few months ago and
the Russian general staff Is being
kept fully informed about our Of
fensive military potential in Europe.


When Prime Minister Churchill
visited Stain recently he further
emphasized the fact that the United
Nations were not In position to
open upsA successful front in West
ern Europe. Reports published SUBJ
sequently said the Russian premier
was angered by this statement of
his British colleague and he ex-
pressed his feelings In no uncertain
words.


The thesis of the Russians that
we must make this sacrifice even If
doomed to failure and that we take
q chance Of losing thousands Of
men and precious war material in
order to show our good will and
keep our pledges cannot be admit
ted by the cold -blooded military
men who are thinking in terms of
winning the war even if it takes
10 years. They know that an offen-
sive for the sake of showing off
would be step toward losing the
war.


They also know, and have told
their Russian colleagues, that failure
of an Allied offensive on the Atlantic
coast would assist Hitler in con-
solidating his gains in the conquered
nations in Europe. These nations
firmly believe that as soon as Amer

The sharp resurgence of fighting
on the entire eastern front, with the
Russians everywhere taking the in
ltlatlve all the way from the Arctic to
the Caucasus, raises the highly in
teresting question whether this NAV

similar to that launched at the be-
ginning of the winter season last
year. The term offensive"" is here
used in its technical military sense.
meaning a major operation co-ordi-
mated over an entire front, as dis
tinguished from tactical offensive
moves OF limited scope and signifi-
cance.


The Russians have long been fore
casting such an offensive when the
Axis advance had expended it's mo-
mentum and when the coming of win
ter gave the Russians certain natural
advantages. For months Moscow
dispatches have limited at large-scale
reserves being trained and equipped
for winter campaign. The huge
losses suffered by the Axis before
Stalingrad and their failure to take
that pivotal city on the Volga leaves
them in an unsatisfactory strategic
situation there, while their similar
failure to take Voronezh, the kew
point on the upper Don, exposes their
flank to attacks which might en-
danger their communications with
the entire Volga-Caucasus front.
The Axis picture becomes still more
dubious with the serious defeat they
have just suffered in the Central
Caucasus. Moscow announces an
important victory at Ordjonikidze,
strategic town which commands both
the principal pass over the noun
tains and the approach to the
Grozhny oil fields. Curiously enough,
this is the first notice the outer world
has had that Axis forces had pene-
trated thus deeply in this sector.
According to Moscow, the Axis has
suffered such heavy losses in men
and equipment that no further
threat to the Central Caucasus may
be anticipated for some time.


Appraisal of the military prospects
on the eastern front are extremely
difficult, because so little is known
as to the relative strength of both
sides. For months, rival armies to-
falling several millions of men have
been battling almost continuously in
what is perhaps the most sustainedly
ferOciOuS conflict of all times. The
upShot must be mutual weakening
of profound significance for future
operations. Despite extensive losses
of territory, resources and popula-
ton. Russia presumably still holds
the edge in manpower. But it is un-
likely that the badly crippled indus
trial system Of the Soviet Union is
able to match the output of Axis
dominated Europe, while the amount
Of munitions and supplies received
from its allies has almost certainly
failed to meet the deficit. II the
Axis could concentrate on the eastern
front as it did last year, the success
of Russian winter offensive would
be. dubious.


However, the amazing transforma-
ton in the overall picture wrought
by recent Anglo-American triumphs
in North Africa introduces a new
element in the situation on the east
ern front. The most immediate con-
sequence has been the undoubted
weakening of German air strength
there, due to the imperative necessity
of diverting much of the LuftWaffe
to the Mediterranean area. Despite
unverified reports, it is unlikely
that Axis ground troops have been
withdrawn directly from the eastern
front. But the German high COM
mand must be using troops from the
general strategic pool for service in
the Mediterranean and North Africa
that might otherwise have been
available for service in Russia. That
indirect drain undoubtedly will in

pelling more cautious policy and
the avoidance Of what, under differ

the Russians to be bolder and to take
bigger chances than they formerly
would have done. Such are the basic
trends. To forecast more would be
Improbable."

 Moscow, October 29. 4 (UP) -- The Soviet press to- day credited the defenders of Stalingrad with inflicting ""the greatest German defeat since the winter defeat at Moscow"" and in the Caucasus Red Army troops drove for- ward in a blizzard to find Nazi troops frozen to death in their dugoutS.

 Reports from the Caucasus said the mountains were now many feet deep with snow and that temper. atures were ""far below zero""

 It was announced, however, that Soviet forces had again fallen back in the vicinity of Nalchik, 50 miles southwest of Mozdok.

 (The German high command said Rumanian and German Alpine troops captured Nalchik).

 Hanks Bent Back

 On the Stalingrad front Soviet drives northwest and south Of the city bent back the German Hanks and inside the battered industrial center Nad frontal attacks were beaten off.

 The Germans were reported to have brought up fresh tank dl- vision and attacked a northern face tory district again with four infali- try and two tank divisions possibly 75,000 men-hut they advanced only 100 or 200 yards, it was said, losing about five battallons in the opera ton-approximately 4,00o to 50,O0O men.

 Northeast of the Tuapse naval base in the western Caucasus, tenn peratures were far below zero, dis patches said. The Germans were using ski and sled attachments in frantic efforts to reach the warmer coats of the Black Sea before the blizzard froze them, or made the mountains completely impossible. :.

 Snow Fills Passes

 Snow, often waist deep, already filled passes and deep gorges. the Communist party organ Prayda said. Avalancfes periodically thun- dered down the mountain sides.

 Soviet ski troops, untitled in heavy furs, were reported counters attack ing, and dispatches said they al- ready had thwarted a further pen- etration toward the Black Sea northeast of Tuapse.

 At one point, the Russians were reported to have split German and Rumanian forces, captured strate- gic height, killed hundreds of enemy troops, and captured much booty and many prisoners.

 Pravada reported that Russian caravans of horses and donkeys laden with supplies were streaming through the snow toward mountain positions. But the snow was so deep that the caravans often became ex- hausted. Then men took the sup plies from the beasts and packed them themselves. Pravda said men often were carrying mountain guns 15 miles after horses and mules bog ged down.

 Attack Thown Back

 At Stalingard, where the weather was verging on winter and just such blizzards as those sweeping the Western Caucasus, the Russians threw back an attack by 1000 Nazia and killed more than 100.

 But in the eastern Caucasus. around Nalchik, 50 miles southwest of Mozdok. the Soviet high com- mand reported the second setback in 24 hours.

Of course not. To prove this we are not confined to theoretical arguments-but facts.

 The ultimate goal of Communism is the establishment ""of world dic- tatorShip of the prolatariat"" (Page 34, Program of the Communist h. ternational Workers Library Pub lication, 1936). Stalin himself de- clared that the Communist party would never give up its dictatorship Thus, Communism robS man of all his fundamental human liberties: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion Jewish, Catholic, Protestant), freedom of assemblage and freedom of educa- tion. These exist only in name in the new Soviet constitution. How can they exist when the new Soviet constitution prevents the establish ment of any other party in Russia except Russian Communism and when nothing can be printed with out receiving the previous approval of Communist censorship.

 The fact that the Communist party, which constitutes less than l 1-2 percent of the total Russian population, insists on being the only existent party in Russia is sufficient answer to lip service democracy loving Communist of South Main street, who says he believes in dem- ocracy. Communists use the freedom granted to them as individuals by 8 democratic government in America to denounce the constitution and to work for the overthrow of our American Democratic government. Once in power they would repeat the history of Russia: They would promptly proceed to remove every bit of the democratic freedom which Americans possess. Words, unless backed by facts, mean nothing. Communists talk about democracy when at the same time they are doing everything to work for the establishment of a Communistic dictatorship.

 When the Communist writer says that Communism has set life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as its goal, i've would like to ask him in what world does he live? Where has he been the last (twenty) years?"" He must be well paid to attempt this Jack-in-the-box, now-you-See- | it-and nd-now-you-don't tactics.

 AS for people who own private property-the grocer. the butcher or the shoemaker-their property is to be left to them for a while ito win the mover"" (Program, p. 49), but all private property must be abolished in the end. (Program, p. 300.

 (Please note: We are in perfect accord with few of the Commun- ist's statements, written in his last letter: ""The American people have 8 right to revolution. It is the right of the majority"" This, in fact, has been our argument right along. Communists do not constitute a ma jority, and so cannot claim for themselves the unique right to be revolutionary.

 ""So, dear (boyl, the right to revo- lution Is not so unique and does not belong pell-melp' to the Communist"

Feeling assured that there will not be an attack on hte Western Front, the Germans are throwing the bulk of their forces into the east, "" Stalin said.

 Informed quarters in London said the German air froce is withdrawing most of it's planes from the Moscow, Leningrad and far north fronts, leaving the land forces to carry on ""the defens- ive' winter campaign.

 Stalin, according to those re- turnnig from Yalta. pointed out that this was to be primarily military conference and France was playing minor role in the war. Since the Big Three were bearing the main brunt of the war, Stalin said he saw no point in having de Gaulle sit ill on conference con- cerned largely with military strategy.

 The Russian war chief was quite definite and repeated the point that if the Yalta con- ference were concerned primar- fly with political and economic postwar problems, 1t would be different. But when military matters were being discussed. he just didn't want dc Gaulle around.

 Then to clinch his views, Stalin recalled that France surrendered to Germany early in the war, and refused to turn over the French fleet to the British as pei treaty arrangement.

 And concluded Stalin, when you landed in North Africa, they fired on you""

 That eAded the matter. RoCse- welt and Churchill, who didn't care much one way or the other, made no further suggestions about de Gaulle.

 LADIES OF CONGRESS

 The menfolk of Congress might take a lesson from the Ladies Congressional club when 1t comes to holding their tempers and keeping their fists in thelr pock- cts.

 On the day that ""Titular Re- publican Leader John Rankin of Mississippi jumped Or the back Of Congressman Hook ot Michigan, all interesting after math occurred at the meeting of Congressional wives who form the Ladies Congressional Club.

 But the ladies engaged in no -pulling-except possibly with their eyes.

 CongresswOman Helen Ga- hagan Douglas of California, wife of movie actor Melvyn Douglas and an actress in her own right, had been asked to give talk. She had some in- teresting things to say about wO- men in politics and she said them with charm and frank ness.

 Among other things she told how a statesman who had helped to introduce women's suffrage claimed that women's entrance in- to politics had not lifted the level of political action. Mrs. Douglas took exception to this and argued that certain women had made rapid political strides in recent years. She also maintained that women could not develop politi- cally overnight, any more than an actress could attain fame and footlights overnight.

 AS an Illustration, she said that many people thought she had be- come an actress right ifter she left college, when as matter of fact she had been studying act- ing almost since the age of five. IRATE MRS. RANKIN

 Then Mrs. Douglas made a plea for sticking to facts and not hid- ing behind prejudice.

Ihe concentric advances of the
Russian armies on Rostov present
some interesting problems involv-
ing the factors of time and distance.


Ihus, the German Army which is
Withdrawing from the Grozny area
Is now west of Nogutskaya on the
RostoV-Baku Railway; it is about
275 miles from Rostov. But the
Russian armies on the lower Don
and the Donets are from 60 to 80
miles from Rostoy. Can they get
there first?


Ordinarily one would be inclined
to the opinion that they could not
because the retreating army from
the Caucasus has good rail lines
available, while the Russians in the
areas mentioned have no open rail-
ways behind them, are operating at
the ends of long and lengthening
INES of communication over bad
roads and are encountering ever
stlffer German resistance as they
approach Rostov itself.


But there are complications.
First. 1t. Gen. Rasmenikoff is do
ing a very good job in the way of
pursuit, He is keeping his advance
going on fairly broad front, and
he is making bold use Of his mount
ed and motorized elements, as testi-
ned to by the speed of his advance
and his continual sweeps to the
f1anks.


Nears Open Country.


He is now on the point of emerg-
Ing from the broken country in
which he has been operating into
more open country, where the su-
perior Russian winter mobility will
count heavily. Moreover, he has
just taken Blagodornoe, the eastern
terminus of a branch line railway
parallelling the Rostov-Baku Rail
way, and if his engineers can
quickly build connecting link from
Budyonovsk to Blagodornoe, along
a route already surveyed and over
comparatively easy terrain, he can
begin to use second line of rail-
way as he advances.


Thus, Rasmenikof seems to have
at least fair chance of increasing
his pressure on the retreating Ger
mans and perhaps compelling their
main force to stand and fight to
avoid being broken up in detail.


Next, we must give little thought
to the operations of 1t. Gen. Yere-
menko, coming down the Stalingrad-
Rostov Railway toward its juno
ton, at Tikhoretz, with the Rostov-
Baku line. Yeremenko has Just
taken Doivnaya, which is about 100
miles from Tikhoretze. He is en-
countering heavy resistance; his
lines of communication are difficult
because they are blocked, at Stalin- !
grad, from direct rail conlmunica-
tion with the main Russian supply
bases, and he can make only limit
ed use of this stretch of railway,
which is ""in the air."" so to speak,
and on which he cannot have much
in the way of locomotives and roll
ing stock.


Nevertheless, he is going ahead,
maintaining contact on his right
with Col. Gen. RoSsokovsky,s army"

 The British backed Russian plan, Churchill, said, envisages the virtu- al extirpation of the Prussian state, with the forced removal from their homeland of most of the Prussian Junkers who traditionally have been the heart and soul of the Ger man military machine.

 The Prime Minister revealed that the United States is fully aware of tn agreement reached between Rus sia and Britain on the Polish ques- tion and that to date 1t has not voiced any objection to it.

 He implied, however, thatt het ime has come for a dfinite American statement on the problem, and an- 71ounced that he would welcome"" a conference with President Roose- welt and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin at the earliest possible date, and preferably in Britain. -s,ss-.ss,st.

 It had bene hoped that the leaders of the three major Allied powers would meet before Christmas, he said, but this proved impossible.

 Churchill indicated the decisions awaiting action by the big-three leaders involve not only the Polish question but also the prosecution of the war in Europe, which. he pre- dicted, can be expected to continue into next summer with the heaviest and costiliest battles still ahead.

 Failure to set up this Allied Mission inside Berlin generally has been blamed on the Russians. However, this column is now able to throw important light on all the facts

 Though Stalin did object to

 American troops entering Der

 lin ahead of the Red Army

 Russian capture of Berlin was agreed on at Yalta), actually U.

 s. officials have been largely responsible for the delay in sending a subsequent tcken

 force into Berlin and setting up

 Allied headquarters to govern Germany.

 If you ask the War Department about this, you will get evasive, sawdust-in-the-eye answers. But actually three reasons have de- veloped for U. s. hesitatoin over entering Berlin. They are:

 1. If an Allied Commission IS set up in Berlin. it would be necessary to abolish SHEAF (Su- preme Headquarters, Allied Expe- ditionary Force) anud General Eisenhower would step down from being commander over the French and British. Instead, the French and British would be equal in command with Eisenhower in any four -cornered Allied Commission in Berlin. So would the Russians.

 2. With all four nations work ing in Berlin, it is feared that CO., operation with the Russians might be more difficult. At present, Russia governs it's part of East ern Germany, while the Western Allies govern their part of Vest ern Germany. There is strict line running between them and no inter-communication to speak Of This is not the plan originally arranged at Yalta. However, there has been so much friction during the closing days of the war, that U. s. commanders fig ure they may be better off remain ing where they are instead of go- ing into Berlin.

 BRITISH HELP IN

 FEEDING GERMANY

 3. The British don't want to change the present setup wherein they are part of SHEAF under General Eisenhower AS SHAEF now operates, the British are able to get a good part of their sup plies from the United States to handle their part of occupied Ger many. Ii SHAEF is disbanded, this supply arrangement stops.

 Under the Combined Ship ping Board, most of the sup plies for the British and Ameri- can armies are even hauled in American ships. And if this stops, the British have the hardest part of Germany on their hands to feed. For the British-occ British-occupied Ruhr and the industrial West are heavily popu- lated With little farmland, for merly importing food from East ern Germany and Prussia But with these eastern areas Russian occupied, the British know they can't get any food from them.

 So the British don't want

 SHEAF and the present U. $. supply arrangement disbanded.

 FINALLY, some U. s. officials fear that cooperation with the French might become difficult if SHAEF were abolished. At present the French have to take orders from Eisenhower. But once an Allied Commission was set up in Berlin, the French would be equal partners, and their ideas on the future governing of Germany might be just as ind!- pendent as the Russians.

 Obviously the present make

 shift situation cannot continue indefinitely. And there is a lot

 of debate inside the Govern

 ment on both sides. Some say

 we had better go ahead and

 try out international coopera-

 tion over Germany right away

 and do our best. Others say we

 had best avoid headaches by"

 The thrust of the Germans south ward to and apparently beyond Bieleyoglina threatened the encir- clement of large Russian forces still battling around Kushchevka, 48 miles north of Bieleyoglina.

To Invasion Across Channel","BY Constantine Broom,","forces In western Europe, stated last
November when we entered North Africa
that If the Allies decided to fight in italy
he would no longer be worried about the
invasion of Western Europe.


The sour ., which reported these words
of the Nazi general Is worthy Of con-
fidence and many Allied leaders are led
to believe that the German general stan
will leave no stone unturned to send to
Marshal Rommel all the men and war
material he needs to make the battle for
Italy so costly that we will be compelled
to send important reinforcements from
this country to Gen. Eisenhower.


In the light of what is happening on
the Russian front 1t is believed that the
Nazis may be able to detach an additional
20 divisions possibly more-to check
our advance in Italy and possibly push
us back.


1t is improbable that important battles
will be fought in Russia in the near
future. Weather conditions, the distance
from the main base Of supply of the
Russian armies-some $50 miles-and
certain amount of weariness after many
months of continuous advance make
major battles on the Dnieper line
extremely unlikely. The American gen.
eral staff is fully aware of the problem
the Russians have in supplying 100000
men with food and ammunition to con-
tinue large-scale operations.


Should the Nazis take advantage Of
this situation and dispatch the 20 more
divisions to Italy our situation would
become dangerous indeed.


Twenty Divisions Destroyed.


1t Is believed in competent quarters
that the Germans will be able to detach
100000 men from the Russian front. The
Allies estimated that their original force
in that area was 224 divisions. Some 20
have been destroyed.


The present Nad line is much shorter
than the line of last July. One hundred
and fifty divisions are considered more
than sufficient as defensive force. The
needed reserves are included In this
number. Fifty divisions thus are left for
fighting in other sectors.


The Berlin high command knows that
weather conditions will make large
scale operations in the Balkans impos-
sible. 1t is not concerned at this time
with an invasion OF Western Europe or
Scandinavia, where the present forces
are more than sufficient to meet any
Allied threat.


They know that our campaign in italy
is no longer feint to cover other opera
tions. The Germans realize that We
have staked our reputation on beating
them there. The offensive may have
been against the better judgment Of the
American military men, but that no
longer matters.


So. 1t appears probable that whatever
Russian front will be rushed to Italy to
enable Marshal Rommel to ward OF the
Allied blows and, If possible. drive us
back with losses


Once embarked on the Italian CAM
paign. it is impossible for us to leave it.
We must push on with every ounce Of
strength at our disposal. If Gen. Eisen-
hover is faced with a numerically supe-
rior enemy he may in the end need re-
Inducements from outside his present
command.


Would Have Assistance.


The implications of such situation
are regarded as grave. Should Gen.
Eisenhower become hard pressed in
few weeks or months, he cannot be re-
fused assistance.


And the troops we may have to rush
to him to equalize the enemy's strength
will have to be taken from those units
earmarked for the invasion of Western
Europe.


A shift of 10, 20 or more divisions from
our invasion bases to Italy would make
our future operations in Western Eu-
rope difficult, If not impossible and the
Russians are not in the mood to give US
any time extension.


They accepted the explanations offered
them after the last meeting at Quebec
as to why a cross-Channel invasion was
not feasible this year. They had some
misgivings about the advisability of an
operation in Italy and for this reason
showed little more than polite approval
of our Mediterranean campaign.
The Russians moved to the Dnieper
line and so far have left unanswered the
Nazi peace approaches. But they have
served notice that they fully expect an
offensive in the west next spring and no
explanation or alibis will be accepted.
The Germans, realizing this, are ex-
| pected to continue the fight in Italy with
| vigor and bitterness. They may even
strip other fronts which are not likely to
be active"" during the winter in order to
give Marshal Rommel the opportunity to
shove us back and compel us to shift our
forces to Italy.


To the German general staff the battle
in Italy is far more important than the

 DRIVE PROBABLE

Large Scale Effort Not Likely for Two Months

 Due to Muddy Terrain",By HARRISON SALISBURY,"United Press Staff COrreSpO O""dent

 London, April 6.--(UP)-If Hit ler's summer plans call for new Russian offensive-as 1t Is believed they do, provided the Nazis think they can carry out the operation before becoming fully occupied with an Allied invasion of western Europa it seems likely the WehrmacIlt will attempt another great drive to"" ward Moscow.

 This conclusion was reached today by analysis in London of results of the great Red army winter offensive and the NaI counterblow which captured Kharkov.

 It was not believed the Germana would be likely to pick the Caucasus and Stalingrad again because, de- spite last summers results, the So. viets managed to put In formidable winter offensive.

 However, If the Nazls could take Moscow or encircle the capital, tho effect certainly would weaken Rus- sia substantially and probably would iInmobilize the Red army insofar as Its offensive chances were con- cerned.

 There is not much chance for the Germans to start such a large scale effort for at least six weeks or two months, because of the muddy ter- rain, most observers thought.

 If the Nazi offensive could be cou- pied with a Japanese attack on Si- beria the Germans presumably would have their greatest chance of immohilizing the Red army. How ever, all quarters in London have the highest confidence in the Red army's ability to stand of the Ger mans, possibly by launching a coun- ter-offensive similar to that at Kharkov last year."

 Moscow, Sept. 10 -(UPl- The Germans opened a general attack on all sectors of the west and south west approaches to Stalingrad yes- terday as the first of the autumn rains fell, but the Russians, after giving up two occupied localities at the outset, were holding today.

 The first of the fall rains, after a summer that had baked the steps to the barrenness of a desert, gave hope to Stalingrad's tired defenders, because, if they continue, Adolf Hit ler's hundreds of tanks may soon be bound by mud.

 The general attack opened early yesterday, dispatches said. The Germans began hitting on every sector with greater tank units and with greater frequency.

 The biggest battle developed on sector west of Stalingrad where the Russians repulsed two attacks and forced the enemy to retreat.

 Covered by dive-bombers and fighters in groups of six and eight, the Germans resumed their attacks. with infantry and tank reinforce ments. Russian fighter planes inc tercepted the German planes at- tacking Soviet positions and a vi1- lage = the focal point of the att tack. Again the Russians repulsed tank thrusts.

 40 Tanks Thrown In

 The Germans regrouped and threw 40 tanks against the narrowest point. Seven tanks broke through, followed by infantry. Although the Ger mans were subjected to violent flank attacks. they forced the Russians to abandon two villages and retreat to new positions.

 Fighting for the villages, however. had been going lon for several daaH before the general attack was opened.

 Front-hne dispatches reported that the Russians had retaken a small railway station outside Stalin- grad. Black, shining Italian tanks for the first time were thrown into fierce counter attacks. Being thinly armored, Russian shells pierced them as if they were tin.

 The battle ragged with undimia- ished violence south of the Terek river in the Mozdok area of the eastern Caucasus, where Adolf Hit Ter had thrown big forces, hoping to drive to the nearby Grozny oil fields from which he had been held two months.

 The Germans appeared to be on the threshold of the city itself and Berlin reports claimed that their ad- vance guard had reached Stalin- grads western suburbs.

 The reports indicated that the Red Army was in equal danger from Nazi th:usts from the northwest and the southwest. The northwestern drive, alone, it was said was being made by 25 Nazi divisions, totalling possibly 375. 900 troops.

 The Soviet reverses were not limited to the critical Stalingrad area. The Rer Army was yielding ground in the Caucasus, falling back on the Grozny oil fields and the Novorossi .: naval base along the Black Sea.

To Invasion From West
Would Relieve Pressure by Keeping Reserves
From Aiding Defense When Allies


Strike Across Water",By Constantine Browu.,"The success of the invasion of
Western Europe is predicated on
the fullest cooperation of the
Soviet armies. Unless they attack
with at least as much violence and
determination as they have shown
at and after Stalingrad the road
ahead of us will be hard and un-
certain. The 1926 Nazi and satellite
divisions which the German high
command is said still to have at its
disposal must be so engaged that
the bulk should be occupied on the
eastern front. The German gen.
erals must not be given the pos
sibility of transferring any of their
forces from east to west to
strengthen the 60 divisions they are
reported to have available in West
ern Europe.


Should the Russians be capable
of this last effort-and there seems
to be no reason why they shall not
continue their offensive against the
heart of the Reich in the course of
this summer-the betting among
military men in Washington is that
before the year is over Germany
will have to capitulate.


The battles ahead of us, from D.
day, which is now very close, to the
time when the German generals
realize that it would be futile for
them to continue the fight, will un-
questionably be the most severe
and costly in history. The German
armies have not given up the hope
for victory. The German generals
are convinced that successful de-
fense of the western wall would
bring about stalemate which could
be politically exploited. The Ger
man general staff considers now its
main task is to defeat our attempt
to gain permanent foothold in
Western Europe.


Would Hold Russians.


The German strategy during the
next few months will be, if our in
formation is correct, to hold the
Russians back by yielding some
ground wherever necessary, while
the divisions which have been con-
centrated in Western Europe will
fight bitter defensive offensive.


1t is difficult, of course, to obtain
a clear picture of the disposition OF
the German forces. From the best
available information it appears
that the western front Is already
saturated"" That Is to say, there
are as many troops manning the
western wall and in reserve as it is
militarily practicable. Besides the
reported so divisions in France and
the Lowlands, another group of
about 40 to SO divisions is said to be
concentrated in Western Germany
ready to be rushed wherever they
may be needed to replace the deci-
mated troops.


The Allies have a fairly compre-
henSive picture of the strength of
the Nazis along the Atlantic wall,
They have prepared the defenses
In that area for more than two
years. In the last IL months, ever
since 1t became obvious that the
main attack of the Anglo-Ameri-
cans would have to come from

area of the central front today
with a break in the blizzard
which had swept the Muscovite
plains for several days, while on
the Stalingrad front the Red
Army has made fresh progress
IN three sectors, the Russians re-
ported today.


Resumption of big-scale opera
tlons in the snoW-crusted Velikie
Lukl-Rzhev area, west of Moscow
was reported to have started with
heavy but ineffective German
counterattacks on wedges driven
into enemy lines in the recent Red
Army offensive.


These clashes were developing all
along the l40-mile strip between
RzheV and Velikie Luki. where
Soviet forces now stand only 90
miles from the Latvian border.


On the Stalingrad front Soviet
dispatches and official announce
ments listed three active areas of
hghtlng, with the Red Army scoring
gains in each.


Fighting Along Rail Line.


The biggest clash about the Volpa
city was reported to the southwest
where battle was in progress for a
large populated center. The place
was not identified, but the fighting
presumably was progressing along
the Stalingrad- -Tikhoretskaya rail-
road, where the Russians were ad-
vancing toward Kotelnikovski.


Occupation of trenches long held
by the Nazis was reported in Stain
grads southern outskirts. North
west of the city the Red Army an
nounced seizure of one heavily for
titled garrison between the Don and
Volga.


Hundreds of German dead were
left on the Stalingrad battlefelds.
the noon communique and dis
patches from the front reported.


tDNB, the German news agen-


cy, said today that the Red Army


had launched attacks with fairly


strong forces supported by tanks


in the Stalingrad area and in the


elbow of the Don River.


The German high command


said that ,263 Russian tanks had


been knocked out of action since


December l on the eastern front


and Nazi forces were credited


with successes on the central,


Stalingrad and Caucasus sectorsJ


Seven Reds Kill Eighty Nazis.


In one sector southwest of Stain
grad, seven picked guardsmen of
the Red Army held off repeated at
tacks by a company of German in

then forced them to flee. leaving 80
dead behind, the Russian commu-

attack by Soviet soldiers on one of

The basis of Russian tactics in
this war appears to be application
of the principle that counterattack
is the heart and soul of successful
defense. The present situation
around Moscow well illustrates their
use of this maxim of war.


Unwilling to accept stalemate, the
Germans have taken advantage of
a break in the weather to launch
another great assault on the Rus
sian capital Their necessities must
have been very pressing to induce
them to risk the certain sacrifices
in men and material on the chance
of success sufficiently great to
justify those losses.


The German high command. of
course. thinks always in terms of
the big picture"" They are prob
ably anticipating defeat in Africa,
at moment when they are desper-
ately trying to whip the Vichy
government into line with the new
order in Europe, and when IL Asia
the affairs of Japan are approach
ing crisis. A great victory Tor the
British in the Libyan Desert would
ring around the world, with roper
cusSions everywhere injurious to the
German cause, unless it could be
offset by the capture of MOSCOW.


Nothing less. no advance in South
ern Russia. for example. would serve
tho Nf
litical machine. Hence German
soldiers by the thousands have had
to die beneath the hail of Russian
fire along the western defenses Of
the Soviet capital.


Freezing Aids Mcchanized Forces.


The freezing OF the Ground has
enabled the German mechanization
TO move faster and farther than
during the -slush period of
few weeks ago. The Germans.
therefore, tried for the ambitious
goal of double encirclemenr. north
and south. according to their time
hOnored tactical ideas. In both
cases they gained ground-to Kiln
and to StalinoeorSk.


The holding attack in the center,
meanwhile. doubtless served the
purpose of all holding attacks by
fixing"" the Russian troops III their
immediate front. But it did not
fix the Russian reserves. some of
which have now been put into
counterattack in both areas.


In both the result appears to have
been the same. The advanced Ger
man armOred elements have been
cut off from their infantry support,
and now face not only the problem
of regaining touch with their Sup
plies. which has brought disaster to
so many German armored spear
heads in the course of the Russian
war but also the danger of pro-
longed exposure to the growing cold
of a Russian winter. deadly to men
brought up in the comparatively
mild climate of the great north
coastal plain of Europe.


Much Depends on Reserves.


The immediate issue turns, there
fore. on whether the Germans now
have sufficient reserves to rescue
their forward elements and to con-
tinue to gain ground by breaking
down the inner shoulders of the
salients they have formed and thus
forcing the Russian center back
toward Moscow. Should they do
this. renewal of the encircling
movements might follow. in the
Of upply OF the Russian capital.


Much, therefore, depends on the
fi9hAng strength of the reserve
forces still available to the respec-
tive armies on the Moscow front

perior in manpower, but it is"

 Just northwest of the capital, a second big Axis force was cut of in l the Pills Hills when the Russians swept across the northern edge of Budapest to the Danube while an- other column captured the Eszter- gom river crossing 19 miles to the northwest

 One Red army spearhead entered the metropolis from Budakeszi, 1 1-2 miles west of the city limits, and occupied zugliget, terminus of a suburban trolley line three miles from downtown Budapest. On its left flank, another force broke into the Lipotmezo district, also three miles from the city center.

 A third column took the south western suburb of Budafok, one mile from the city line, and the adja- cent Budaors section, site of Buda- pests main airport.

 Airport Under Fire

 With the city's second main iar- port on the east side of the Danube at Matyasfold already under artil- lery fire, the fall of Budaors ended the Nazis' last hope of supplying their trapped garrison by air.

 Pilissvorosvar, five miles north west of Budapest, also was taken by the Soviets. and another force swept around the northern end of the city on a three e-mile front, cap- turing Urom and Pomaz within two miles of the Danube. The Russians were believed to have reached the river beyond those towns.

 At the same time, Marshal Feo- dor I. Tolbukhin's Third Ukrainian army forces beat of fierce counter attacks along the western and northwestern perimeter of their siege arc and extended their belt around that side of the city to depth of 20 to 30 miles, precluding the possibility of Nazi relieving thrust into Budapest.

 Particularly fierce fighting was reported north of Szekesfehervar, where the Soviets destroyed 32 en- emy tanks and captured Csakar, Szar and Orosziany, the last 30 miles west of Budapest.

 New Russian successes also were reported northeast of the capital, where the Second Ukrainian army drove up to the Hrony river on the eastern edge of the Bratislava Plain The SovietS reached the river on 13-mile front from Rybnik to Svety Jur Ma Hrony, and midway between those towns took Horny Sec, 97 miles east of Vienna.

ELIOT,","The capture of Novorossisk seems
likely to simplify the German trans
port and supply problem IN the
North Caucasian area. The harbor
is by far the best on the whole
Caucasian shore all the way from
the Kerch Strait to the Turkish
frontier. Rail and road connections
with the interior, especially the for
mer, are ample: there is a direct
line to Stalingrad and connections
by way of Krasnodar to Baku, as
well as the coastal line to Batum.


With Novorossisk as an advance
base and supply depot, the Ger
mans will be in a much better posi-
ton than formerly, as far as sup
plies are concerned, to conduct
large-scale military operations in
the Caucasian area, provided they
can solve the problem of supplying
Novorossisk itself by sea.


Their first need will be to collect
enough small craft of various sorts
to keep a maritime shuttle service
running between Novorossisk and
Kerch go miles,, or between
Novorossisk and Feodosia (120
niles. These two ports are in the
Crimea and have direct rail con-
nections with German occupied
Russia and with Germany itself.
1t Is to be presumed that by this
time the German engineers have
altered the gauge of the Crimean
railways SO that standard gauge
trains can be run from Germany
all the way to Kerch and Feodosia.


Shipping Requires Protection.


However, the problem of assem-
bling enough shipping is only part
OF the task. That shipping must be
adequately protected on its short
coast-wise run to Novorossisk. The
greater part of the run can be made
at night, thus utilizing the cover
OF darkness. Air escort can be pro-
vided and this will be especially
useful in the field of reconnaissance,
since wide daylight sweeps over ad-
jacent waters should be able to de-
tect the approach of Russian war
ships from the southwark in time
to give warning of impending at
tacks on the night-running conveys.


The conveys themselves can be
escorted by motor torpedo boats, of
which the Germans are believed to
have a number in the Black Sea.
They also have few small subma-
rines which were brought down the
Danube in sections and assembled
at Rumanian and Bulgarian ports.
These have limited radius of ac-
ton, but with Novorossisk as an
advance base, they might be able
to operate effectively against the
Russian Black Sea fleet.


The, Red fleet would not be able
to attack the coastal conveys with
out bringing it's ships within the
radius of action of the German
shore-based bombers, so that even
If considerable damage is done to
the conveys. at first, a process of
attrition may be set up which will
reduce the Russian naval strength
progressively as time goes on.


Ships Can't Be Replaced.


1t must be remembered that the
Black Sea feet, unlike most navies,
is in the unfortunate position of be-
ing unable to replace ships which
are lost and is finding increasing
difficulty in repairing those which
are seriously damaged.


1t is to be presumed that the float

with straw spread on the floor and
iron cots ranged along the walls,
while the artillery sang its deep,
hoarse lullaby. In the morning, we
found pouring rain had reduced
the dirt road to a terrible bog of
oozing black mud. We set out,
nevertheless, for Yelnia, greatest
objective yet taken by the Red

and shell craters, under drenched
pine trees, and across soggy fields,
we slogged all the day. We slept
that night in a pine forest outside
Dorogobuzh and drove on the next
day to Yelnia.


On the battlefield, we traced the
first major Russian victory OF the
war, a victory which elected the
Germans, for the first time on any
front, from any considerable
amount of territory. A brigade
commissar, who had taken part IN
the action explained it to us.


Here, the Germans own tactics
of encirclement and determination
had been turned against the Nazis
for the first time, tactics which
they were to face again in the
battles of Moscow and Stalingrad.


The graveyard of Yelnia itself,
which the Germans fired before
they left, was lined with the skel-
etons of burned houses, standing
like lonely sentinels along the raw
aged streets. Around the city the
fields were torn by tank treads,
slashed by anti-tank bitches, and
strewn with shattered Gotta ges.


The devastation was far greater
than anything had seen after the
war in the west. There, after the
fall of Paris, I found the battle
had passed swiftly and lightly over
most places, punching only a few
holes in a village here, wreckins
a crossroads there. Around Yelnla
all was consumed in frightful
all-devastating struggle between
two giants, fighting savagely tt
the death.

WITH THE RED ARMY ON THE
RZHEV FRONT.-It is an unprece-
dented experience to visit a wal
front, whole series of headquar-
ters and advance posts, and find two
men sharing the command, whether
1t is the command of division or a
regiment, or whatever the unit may
be. Mine, perhaps, is the first and
last such experience that any for
eign correspondent will have, at
least for an unpredictable period
for the status of the Red Army S
commissars has just radically been
altered by governmental decree.


Nevertheless, the former commits
sars of all ranks-from the rank
equivalent to captain up to the
rank equivalent to full general-are
still in the Russian Army and their
contribution to Russia's fighting &C
tivities will still be extremely great
Their new functions merely change
the manner in which their unques-
tionably high capacities will be used


Commissars All Leaders.


In various sectors of the Rzhev
front I have met dozens of commits
sars including many who have es-
corted me around for hours and
including several who are as widely
known in the Red Army as the gen.
erals with whom they have shared
command. Without exception these
men bore the stamp of leaders-of
leaders in the civil and political as
we'll as the military sense. Among
these younger commissars you find
a keenness and a grasp OF the full
scope of the world conflict which
is nothing short of notable. For
intelligence they probably surpass
In average the intelligence of any
men of similar age and authority in
any army in the world.


For the 16 months of the Russo
German war, the commissarS, as
fighting teachers-p -preachers-propa-
gandists and efficiency experts, have
admittedly achieved wonders at
building and maintaining the Red
Army soldiers morale. When you
talk with them you understand how
they have done it. By an acute,
unceasing interest in the common
soldiers welfare, needs and per-
plexities. BY personal courage and
power of personal example. BY
prompt removal of sources of dis
satisfaction and complaint. BY liv-
ing always on terms of utmost de-
mocracy and intimacy with their
men.


Must Be Soul of Regiment.


When Stain said the commissar
must be the soul of the regiment
or of his company"" he meant just
that


AS Ilya Ehrenbrg says, ""The
commissar occupies himself first OF
all with the heart of the soldier""


For the past two months, Stalin-
grad, in considerable part, has re-
manned standing as monument to
the Red Army commissars' devotion
to and fulfllment of their task. Now
most of the commissars Of the upper
grades will become regular military
commanders in the Red Army-but
they will be officers of the broadest
and most thorough general training
that surely any modern army has
ever had.


With the change in the commits
sars' status, the Red Army will re-
vert to the system of single COM
mand of all military units and at
this stage of the war that may prove
to be a definite advantage. There
will be the temptation abroad to
assume, therefore, that the COM
missar system was failure. On
the basis of much previous inquiry
and on the basis of these days OF
observation in front sector, l am
convinced that such seeming con-
clusion would be entirely erroneous.


Morale Building Function.


Even if a singleness of individual
command has shown itself desirable
the new decree takes great care to
retain the tremendously useful mo-
building functions OF the COM
missars. While Army commanders
have now been given full RESPONSE
bility for military decisions, new
post of assistant commander fol
political work. has been established
This means a great number OF the
younger commissars will continue
their work almost exactly as before
with the one difference that they
will be subordinate to the military
commanders of their units.


The full significance of the re-
vised status of the Red Army's COM
missars will be lost unless full ac'
count is taken of the opening ur
of the regular officers ranks to older
more experienced commissars: Either
Immediately, in few cases, or after
special officers training courses fol
a great many other. In other words
the decree taps a great reservoir
of officer material for the Russian
Army and the major portion o.
their reservoir consists of men al
ready highly trained in Leadership
and closely experienced with front
line warfare.

 A German hint that the capture of Stalingrad may not be effected in the present campaign was given by a military spokesman in Berlin who was quoted as saying that the high command did not regard the battle as concluded and consequently was busily engaged in building de- fensive positions at Stalingrad and strengthening the Nazi lines in obyi- ous anticipation of a Russian coun- ter-attack.

 German reports indicated that preparations for a counter-blow had been noted north of Stalingrad and London heard that the Russians were preparing to make another smash on the Rzhev salient north west of Moscow."

 On April 25th news came from vichy that the Russian Ambassador, Jacob Suritz, was recalled to Mos- COW at the request of the French government. Perhaps this official Incident is linked with the footing story.

 Neverthless, the Great Soviet Empire has been enriched by all the personal effects of little Lithu- ania's Minister to France, Petras klhnas, the letters state that the Soviet Russian invaders are not satisfied with what they seized in Lithuania, they also want the toys of the Lithuanian diplomats chil- 1ren, their clothing, personal photo- yraphs and whatever else they can yrab."

Out of it will come either World Peace and an ordered world for the next 50 years; or the early seeds of another war.

 Roosevelt's problem will be to persuade Stalin and Churchill to go along on broad unselfish peace plans, including Dumbarton Oaks, at time when most of the trump cards no longer are in his hands.

 Four years ago, just after France fell, Churchill would have given anything, any kind of broad peace machinery, any reasonable part of the Empire to secure American Support. Today he will not even promise the return of Hongkong to China

 Three years ago when Russia was fighting back to the wall at Stalingrad, Stalin would have given far-reaching pledges for a broad peace plan. Today he will not even accept Dumbarton Oaks unless Russia has a veto of the Council of the United Nations to block any disciplinary action against an ag- gressor nation.

 FDR. has to face the fact that both Stalin and Churchill now have most of what they want, and Roosevelt is left with almost no trump cards, except the humani- tartan appeal that the Allies must not abandon the goal of peace for which mankind fought, plus the threat that the American people, if disillusioned, will become isola- tionist as never before.

 THE BIC THREE"" AGENDA

 Perhaps the toughest nut Roose- welt has to crack is to secure Stalin's acceptance of the Dum- barton Oaks peace machinery with out crippling amendments. First, however, let's examine the points on the agenda which should be easier. There are six main items on the Big Three"" Agenda, as fol- lows:

 l. WAR AGAINST JAPAN-This was promised by Stalin at Teheran as soon as Germany was defeated. It was promised in return for the Allied second front in Germany and there is no reason to believe Stalin will not keep this pledge. He has been meticulous in keeping prom ises once they have been given. and F.DR. expects no trouble about this.

 2 POLAND-Rooseve is propos- ing a compromise whereby Premier Mikolajczyk, recently resigned from the London-P Polish Government, will enter the Russian-inspired Lublin Government of Poland The United States and Britain would then recognize the Lublin Government. The President is also proposing that Russia withdraw some of it's claims to old Poland as conciliatory ges- ture to the Poles.

 3. THE BALTIC PROVINCES The United States will now recog- nize Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as part of Russia Thus far the United States has recognized them"

 The asSailant, a trusted friend who had been given the freedom of the villa, was known as Frank Jack son, an American, and was said to have an American wife. But he told Gen.

 As regards reports that Dreschd had disagreed with Trotsky on the fourth international. it was asserted today that there had been a split in the organization, apparently over administration and policy.

He has managed to come out as the friend of all sides, and most important of all, the mediator between Russia and the United States.

 In other words, Eden has com- pletely reversed the previous role of President Roosevelt, who up until his death had acted as the mediator between Churchill and Stalin. aA

 The Churchill -Stalin rivalry was not merely personal. It was his toric. It was based not only on the fact that Churchill just after the last war. urged the sending of Allied troops into Russia to help the White Russian Generals over throw the embryo Bolshevik re- girne, but that he flirted with the Cliveden Set which in 1889 advo- cated war between Russia and Germany while England Sat on the side lines. A.

 This was the basis for the per- sonal suspicion between him and Stain. But historically, Churchill was carrying out century void British policy of isolating Russia. For 100 years, the country with the greatest land mass in the world, Russia, had been kept without a warm-water seaport by Brittsin, the country with the greatest navy in the world.

 That rivalry was the reason for the Anglo-Japanese alliance, where by the British, working through Japan, helped to stop Russia from getting Manchuria and a warm water port on the Pacific.

 That rivalry was behind Britain's sphere of influence in Persia (now Tram to prevent Russian use of the Gulf of Persia. That rivalry was also the cause of the Crimean War in which the British Fleet and British troops actually landed on the same spot where Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt later held their Yalta Conference and waged a bloody battle to prevent the Czar from coming down to the Darde- nelles and getting an outlet through the Mediterranean."

The Union of Po- fish Patriots is the organization of Poles formed inside Ruscsia and working closely with the Soviet. It has always been Sus- pected that the Soviet planned to construct a new Polish govern ment, perhaps with communist leanings, using the Polish Patri- ots as a nucleus.

 Moscow, July IS. - (UP) German forces, driving in- to the Don River bend, have by-passed the important in- dustrial city of Voroshilov- grad, it was announced to- day. Pushed back at Voro- nezh, and facing strong counter-attacks at the south ern end of the front, the Germans were throwing all avail able reserves into action as their planes landed troops behind the Russian lines, front dispatches re- ported.

 Many towns and villages were re- ported af1ame along the 200-mile battle front between Voronezll and Millerov-Voroshilovgrad area.

 Planned Retreat

 The Russians were giving ground in steady, planned retreat.

 Strong rear guard units were left to make a last stand and they were reported inflicting heavy losses on the enemy Hanks.

 The Germans were pushing on relentlessly for vital Staligrad, on the Volga, and the railroad junction of Likhaya, where the Moscow Rostov and Stalingrad- -Rostov rail- roads cross.

 Voroshilovgrad, which the Ger mans had by-passed, is an import ant industrial center, named for Marshal Klementi Voroshilov who was born there.

 All reports from the front indi- cated that the pincers movement which the Germans launched last week to encircle Voronezh had mis- carried.

 Moy Be Cut",BY ROBERT J. MANNING,"Washington, May IA - (UP) - More big lend-lease cuts, including a slash of nearly 50 per cent in U. s. war aid to Britain, were in prospect today following curtail- ment of the bulk of this country's $500, 100000 month shipments to Russia.

 Some top U. s. officials were said on good authority to believe the drastic cut in lend-lease to the Soviet Union might figure in relax ing the stalemate on the Polish situation.

 Though the Russian curtailment assertedly was based solely on the fact that Russia is no longer a fighting ally. it was said to demon Strate a willingness on this coun- trys part to be tough. On the diplomatic front, this, it was felt, might further convince Premier Stalin that the U. s. will not yield to Russian wishes in regard to Po- land.

 Russia is anxious to win recogni- tion for the Soviet-sponsored Po- fish government now installed in Warsaw, while Britain and the U. s. are insisting that the govern ment must first be reorganized ln line with the Yalta agreement. It was pointed out that while lend-lease is strictly a war opera tion, Russia is anxious to receive postwar credits from this country to enable her to buy American ma chinery with which to rebuild Rus sian industry. This country's readl- ness to cut lend-lease shipments promptly and without hesitation was seen as a hint to Russia to meet other Allied nations halfway or face difficulty with the postwar financing problem.

 President Truman is expected 10 make an announcement on Russian lend~lease shortly.

 Stalin's appeal for 8 war of arl- initiation against Germany and his hope that a ""second front"" would be opened up soon to relieve the Red army.

 Release of a message of felicita- ton from Mir. Roosevelt to the peo- pie of Russia, through President Michail Kalinin of the Soviet cen- tral executive committee. It was the first United States recognition of the revolutionary holiday since 1888.

 The outpouring of American aid and sympathy to Russia was in strik- ing contrast to the attitude during the last two years and to the oc- casion 24 years ago when the United States severed diplomatic relations with the successful revolutionists.

 Litvinovs appointment brought back the memory of the 1883 nego- tiotions here in which he partici- pated, resulting in recognition of the Soviet government. There were some misunderstanding at that time in which Litvinov was involved. par- ticularly regarding repayment of the Russian war loans. But officials were inclined to overlook those mat ters now.

 Loan Arrangements

 The loan arrangements gives the Soviet Union $l ly000, 100000 to draw upon for military equipment, munitions and raw materials. Some of 1t will be repaid in Russian raw materials, which Stalin assured Mir. Roosevelt would be expedited.

 Russia produces furs, magnesium ore. potash, phosphate rock and as- bestos, among other things. In ad- Gition to war supplies the United States will send Russia leather, woolens, cotton and other materials.

 Soviet balances in the United States have been exhausted by cash payments for war materials. Two loans total s40,00O. .OOO, GOO had been made previously against future gold deliveries. Of that sum $l0,000. 900 has been repaid.

 The REC also made a loan colm- mittment of $iOO. .OO0, 900 to be repaid by Russia in raw materials. The Russians have drawn half of that amount."

 The Russians opened a relief Of- fensive against the Germans south of Stalingrad about 10 days ago, and in the first six days drove them beyond a range of hills on Stalin- grads southern outskirts, killing 1000 and destroying 160 tanks.

 The Russians had paused to con- Solidate positions won in the first phase of the drive, and now were pushing on again in an effort t0 draw some of the pressure away from northern Statngrad.

Despite numerical super iority, the enemy tanks were unable to make a stand and withdrew. Soviet tanks destroyed 16 of the German tanks""

 Three Small Gains

 The Germans have made thres slight gains-one yesterday of 50 to 100 yards-during the last sev- eral days in the industrial district. While none was serious in itself, the aggregate was a serious threat to the outnumbered defenders.

 Marshel Seymon Timoshenk0's re- lief offensive northwest of Staiin- grad also gained slightly. Soviet attachments penetrated German lines during the night and wiped out in hand to hand battle and with grenades 160 Germans.

 No U. S. military observers have been permitted at the front with either the Russians or the Germans, so all they can do is wait in Moscow and Berlin and accept the stereo- typed statements handed them by German Russian military leaders.

 Army strategists in Washington, however, have worked out their ideas on how the Russian should conduct their campaign. And here is the U. s. Army's strategy:

 They would have the Russians follow the same tactics as the Union armies during the U. s. Civil War. That war saw some of the most bril- liant strategy in military history. But although General Lee outfought the North and gained far more ter ritory, he was never able to disrupt the Northern army. It remained intact.

 Thus Lee always faced the threat of the Northern forces bouncing right back at him. And Washington is hoping that Stalin's troops will do the same.

 It is probable that the Russians cannot hold too long against we'll organized panzers. But even if they inflict terrific punishment. and iali back very slowly. it might delay action until the rainy season starts in the fall; by which time the United States will be turning out a real arsenal."

A good many weeks of this pounding will have to continue before an in vasion of Western Europe-where Stalin wants it most-could take place successfully.

 : 2. Churchill has always turned thumbs down on sacrificing any large body of British troops in in vading Western Europe. This is not new. It was his policy when Molotoff and Stalin urged and begged him for 2nd Front all of last summer. It was also reported to be his position at Casablanca where 2nd Front was definitely promised. In other words when an invasion was to be started it must include a pre- dominant percentage of American troops.

 This has been historic British policy - namely that she fights on the sea and teams up with an ally which does the fighting on land. So it is not unreasonable to assume that Churchill stuc.i to this during his current talks with Roosevelt.

 U-BOATS BLOCK U. s.

 3. The submarine menace has been such that it is impossible to send large body of U. S. troops to England. And invasion of Western Europe would require half a million Americans, assum- ing that Churchill would go in on a 5O-5O basis, and despite the buoyant submarine statements Of Frank Knox, so large a shipment could not be accomplished in a short time.

 5. An invasion of Italy would not be difficult, but after &C., complaining it there are still the Alps - plus 40,000,o00 hungry Italians to feed.

 G.. Finally there is the question of invasion through Turkey and the Balkans. It is quite con- ceivable that Churchill argued at some length for this. After all, it has been his thesis ever since the fateful Gallipoli campaign in 1915 that the easiest way to hit Germany was through Turkey and the Balkans.

 However, there has bene a cen tury-old jealousy between Britain"

 The President stepped down the gangway of the U. s. Cruiser Augusta at Antwerp at 11:10 a. m. Sunday, (3:10 a. m. EWT), to be- come the first chief executive to set foot on Western European soil since Woodrow Wilson went to Paris 26 years ago for the peace that failed.

 Accompanied by Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Fleet Admiral William F. Leahy and small party of advisers, the snil- ing man from Missouri was met py Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ad- miral Harold R. Stark, Charles Sawyer, U. s. ambassador to Bel gium, and local British and Amer ican military commanders. Wearing a double-breasted gray business suit and grey felt hat, MT. Truman conducted a brief inSpec- tion of an honor guard from the 35th division, his World War outfit.

 Then the Presidential party mo- tored to the Melsbroeck Airdrome on the outskirts of Brussels and MT. Truman boarded Eisenhower'S Spe- cial plane, arriving in Potsdam at AIS D. m. Q0:15 a. m. EWTO.

 At Pots dam, he was greeted by Soviet Marshal Gregory K. Zhu- kov's deputy, General Alexander Sokolovsky, and Col. Gen. Alexander Gorbatov, Red Army commandant of Berlin.

 American, British and Russian tanks and infantrymen surrounded the entire airfleld sector and banned all but the official military photog- raphers.

 Stepping spryly down the trans port plane ladder MT. Truman shook hands cordially with the Rus sian envoys and received the Presi- dential honors from color guard of the U. s. Second Armored Divi- sion.

 Immediately after the arrival ceremonies, he was whisked 15 miles away to his official residence, a 30- room house appropriated from wealthy Berliner and furnished by the Red Army, within 10 minutes drive of the meeting place.

 The president ate an early dinner with his personal staff and went to bed shortly after 10 o'clock SO that he could be up early and ready Tor business.

 Churchill Follows Truman

 Churchill, fresh from week long vacation in Southern France, flew into Potsdam about two hours after the president, accompanied by his daughter, Mary.

 Wearing the uniform of an army colonel, the 73-year- Prime Minister lit up his inevitable cigar as soon as he touched the ground, tucked his stick under his arm and went briskly through the reception ceremony. He broke off the offl- cial inspection of the honor guard abruptly, however. apparently 10 avoid undue strain.

 Beyond the fact that Stalin ana his Foreign Commissar, Vyacheslav Molotov, had arrived in Berlin, there was no official word on the whereabouts or doings of the Rus- sian delegation in advance of the meeting.

 For the Soviet premier it was his first trip outside Russia since the Teheran meeting with Churchill and the late President Roosevelt in Nov ember, 1943, and 1t was the first public visit to Germany in his car- ger.

 The British American Russian commission set up at Yalta to form new Polish government has been deadlocked for weeks. The Rus sians disagree with the Americans and British over the position of the Soviet-backed Lublin Poles in tie new government.

 The problem has reached stage where it is being handled on the highest level the Roosevelt . Churchill -Stalin level. That was the one on which the original agreement was made.

 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's promise to discuss the Polish situation in the House or Commons next Thursday was, in effect, weeks notice to Premier Josef Stalin to come to an under standing with his Allies quickly or to face Churchill announcement of the commissions failure.

 That is the situation as MT. Roosevelt prepares to take his fourth oath aS president in a more or less family party on the White House stoop. Unlike some of the previous conferences between Mir Roosevelt and Churchill or the lel3 Big Three meeting in Tehran, this one must seek agreement on certain matters with which the pub lie is familiar and about which it will demand specific information when the conference is over.

 A communiQue in terms of gem ersl assurances that the conferees have reached general agreement on the matters before them will not answer the questions that even the most casual readers of newspapers now are competent to ask about the political points of view in Washing ton, London and Moscow.

 Well informed readers of neWspa- pers will want to know whether the big three can find a government of Poland which all three can recog- nize and what has been agreed upon for Poland's postwar frontiers end system of government, They will want to know how Mr. RooSe- velt, Churchill and Stalin finally decided the proposed world security council shall vote.

 The Dumbarton Oaks conference was unable to agree on that, Russia holding out for a veto right against collective security for each perma- nert council member, even If that member were the one charged with aggression.

 The war with Germany is Suffi. ciently near its end now for tho Big Three to agree precisely or what shall happen to her in the postwar world--and who shall per. form the operations, if any, Those are merely some of the pending questions.

 POINTS OUT",,"Editor, Waterbury Democrat:

 The recent controversy over Ar ticle l24 of the Russian Constitu- ton in which the President stated that there was not much difference between the Soviet Constitution and our own American Constitution which grants freedom of religion to all persons, does not set well with 8 majority of Americans.

 It is true that religious freedom in Russia is one thing, and practice of 1t is another. Stalin rules Rus sia under a document that except for the clause which provides for freedom of anti-religious propa- ganda is practically the same as our own. Bill of Rights, only the siynil- arity ends there.

 This last outrage has finally turn- ed the stomachs of decent American citizens who for long time were willing to go along in the hope that somehow or other the administra- ton would get us through the war without making blood sacrifice of another American Army. But the hypocrisy of attempting to make Russia appear like 8 God-fearing nation that guarantees religious freedom is the last straw. Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen great exponent of Catholic thought and opinion, has blasted that in these few telling paragraphs:

 ""As proof of the window-d dressing character of the New Constitution of Russia, 1t is well to remember, that Article l24 makes distinc- ton between worship and propa- ganda.' It guarantees freedom of religious WORSHIP and freedom of anti-religious PROPAGANDA In other words, a citizen has a right to worship God according to this con- science, if he can find church, or If he can find a minister, 6 priest, or rabbi. But these are extremely difficult 10 find. For example, before the revolution there were 10000 Christian churches and chapels In Russia. The Communist Party has recently declared that at the end of the second Five-Xear Plan. namely 1887. there win not be Q single edi- flee in all Russia eonsecfatcd to re- lIglon.

fell to the Russians yesterday, the
war bulletin said, bringing the bag
for the most important week of
fighting in the Soviet summer Of
fensive to 1,500. All along the grim
route the Germans were resisting
desperately, hurling masses of troops
into counterattacks which failed to
halt the Red Army. More than
5000 Nazis we're slain and scores of
tanks and other heavy equipment
were destroyed in the fighting, the
Russians said


In the Donets Basin, the Russians
were rapidly maneuvering into posi-
ton for knockout blow at Stalino,
industrial city and mining center
which the Germans have held and
heavily fortified since they first cap
tured it in October, 194l.


One unit battled its way into
Khartsyzsk, Is miles east of Stalino,
and another captured Artemovsk, AZ
miles north. Great minefields and
a complicated system of tank traps
barred the approaches to Artemovsk,
a rail junction point, which the
Russians said fell only after a hard
battle.

 TRADE OUTLETS

 WASHINGTON, July l8-Russia's age-old quest for her own trade out lets to the open ocean may come close to fulfillment at the Berlin Big Three conference.

 Diplomatic authorities here believe the question of ocean traffic bottle necks which allow other countries tc control all the best passages to the Soviet Union may occupy a promin- ent position at the Potsdam discus sions.

 These bottlenecks include the Yel- low Sea approaches to Russia's Sib- erian back door. The prospect is that regardless of talk or lack of talk about Soviet participation in the wal aeanist Japan, there will be fairly full exploration of Russia's political intentions in Eastern Asia.

 Port Arthur Involved

 These intentions are believed to be dominated to a considerable extent by Russia's commercial aspirations in the Pacific. Involved directly is tke question of Port Arthur. Russia once tcok a 99-year lease on that North China port, and Premier Sta lin generally is expected to demand it's use again.

 But neither Port Arthur nor any ether outlet that far south is likely to have any security unless the Rus sians control approaches to it. For that reason, and several others President Truman is anxious to find cut Stalins' general ideas on the fu- ture of East Asia regardless of what Russia does about the war.

 Island Disposition

 Similarly the question of disposi- tion of Japanese islands in the North Pacific is likely to come up. Russia is expected to claim Karafuto, the southern half of Russian held Sak- halin. But ships moving to the As iatic mainland have to go through passages in the Japanese chain or in the Kuriles to the north. As a re- suit there has been speculation that Stalin might want one. of these pas sages to have Russian-held Hanks"

 But beneath the surface they will be lrrltated at several things which have lowered Good Neigh bOr' prestige to about the lowest cob since 1927 when U $. Marines invaded Nicaragua.

 Irritant No. l-IS growing indi- cation that the U. $. A. intends to keep certain Latin American bases after the war There b nothing that rifles Latin America more than American armed forces on their soil.

 Irritant No. 2.-Is the peremp- tory way President Roosevelt re- gently demanded that six Good NeighbOrs"" come into the war. Some people wondered why Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, ant Ecuador trooped up to the Allied table just as the Red Army neared Berlin and signed up.

 This was not because they wanted to. It was because they got letter from no less than the President of the United States telling them to join the Allies-or else.

 The 'Or else"" was a warning that they could not sit at the United Nations conference, now scheduled for San Francisco, if they did not declare war.

 What made the Latin dOubiy sore was their belief that RoO3c- welt was acting at the instance of Stalin who had laid down the law that no nOn-belliger- ent could sit in United Nations Councils. Most of the Latin American governments don't recognize Stalin and don't like dictatiOn from him-even if in- direct.

 Also they remembered the oral word of the State Department that all they had to do was to break relations with the Axis, not de- clare war. For instance, Chile, when it broke with the Axis, in formed the State Department that it was also ready to declare war. But Under Secretary of State Sumner WelleS, after conferring with the White House told them this would be unnecessary. All VIC wanted was a break in diploma tic relations, the Chileans were told. So now when we need American solidarity more than ever, the Good Neighbors aren't too happy.

 FRANCO HAUNTS MEXICO

 Last month, members of the old Spanish Cortez tried to hold a meeting in Mexico City. The Cortez is the Spanish parliament, and ever since Franco set up his dictatorship, it's members have been eXiled, many in Latin Amer ica.

 So it was proposed that the remnants of Democratic Spain get together and hold a meeting ill Mexico City.

 But they did not reckon with our State Department.

 When James C. Dunn (hus- band of the Armour milliOns) called before the Senate during the confirmation fight over his promotion to be assistant sec retary of state. he told SenatOr Guffey of Pennsylvania that the had never been favorable to Franco. Since then he has in- Spired series of newspaper col umns purpOrting to tell how he had nothing to do with the boy colt of LOyalist Spain.

 However, when two members of the Spanish Cortez sought pass port visas to cross the Panama Canal to attend the meeting in Mexico City, the State Depart ment said no. The Spanish con- gressmen were south of the Pan- anna Canal and the Mexico City meeting was north. The canal lay across their path, and the State Department refused to let them cross. The man in the State Department who passes primarily on these matters is James c. Dunn. Hull is no longer in the State Department. Stettinius was either away or busy with the Big Conference. The main decision was up to Dunn.

 So the Spanish COrtez could not get quorum and was not held. But In some respects the Inter American conference now"

 Showdown Battle

 Moscow dispatches said that the Red army, apparently massing its strength for a showdown battle on the twisting lower Don river, had retired southeastward in good order and was fighting back strongly with the aid of American-built bombers in defense of Rostov and in in- creasing offensive thrusts on the enemy flank at Voronezh.

 Great destruction of Axis tanks, airplanes, trucks and army units was reported as result of the Rus- sian counter blows, and at Voronezh the Soviet onslaughts had trapped large Axis forces by severing their communications lines and knocking out 50 enemy tanks.

 But on the major front to the southeast the Germans claimed ad- vances of as much as 90 miles in the past four or five days and a Vichy report said they were within four miles of the suburbs of fire ravaged and heavily bombed Rostov, key to the oil-rich Caucasus.

 The attack on Rostov from the west (Taganrog), the north (Voro- shilovgrad and the east Cat the conjunction of the Don and Donets rivers) was the climatic goal toward which the Germans have been ham, mering in their costly southeastern offensive to isolate the Caucasus, cut of the route of American war supplies to the south and divide the Soviet armies.

 Advances 90 Miles

 At the same time, the enemy re- ported that an Axis column fork ing off below Vorenezh at the bend of the Don river had advanced about 90 miles to within approximately 50 miles of the easternmost turn of the Don river, which flows within about 35 miles of Stalingrad on the Volga. The two Axis offensives, probably supplemented by a third push along the railroad from Lik- haya toward Stalingrad, are of equal importance in the battle for i the Caucasus.

 Rostov, battered by enemy bomb- CTS for several days, was reported by the Germans to be 'a'fiame."" The communique also said that the bridges acros sthe Don at that point over which the Russians might re- tire from Rostov-had been de- strowed. Rusia rear guards ""and dispersed enemy groups are being annihilated"" by the Nazi air force the communique claimed.

 The Russians told a different story. They said that ground was yielded to the enemy but that a high price was exacted and that the Red army had fallen back in good order, leaving rear guarcs who ap- piled rigorous scorched earth policy and killed many thousands advanc- ing Germans.

 Apparently the German claims oi sudden advances and of encircline attacks by armored forces and air planes were based on the final re- tirement of these rear guard ele- ments which had held back the Axis tide while Soviet Marsha! Semyon Timoshenko prepared his ground for a decisive stand, pre- sumably along the Don. It appeared l unlikely tbat the Russian military i leaoer, who fast year drove the Ger mans back in panic from Rostov te Taganrog, would give up Rostov al this critical juncture with a last ditch fight like at Sevastopol ano similar to the one being made tc hold Voronezh.

 Massing Strength

 On the eastern flank, the Rus sians had been reported massing their strength for defense of Stall inggrad and the lower Volga and 1t was believed likely that the main battle would be fought in the com paratively narrow area between the Don and Volga rivers.

 The present phase of fighting may well determine possession of the main oil supplies of the Soviet Union. The Russians have strongly defended the northern end of the pipe line that leads from the Cas- plan coastal fields to Rostov and then northwestward to Nikitovka forcing the enemy to detour around the line en route to Rostov. The line north of Rostov, however, is now rendered useless by the German fianking advances or may have been seized at some points after being destroyed by the Russians.

 Capture of Rostov, or its encircle- ment, would permit the Germans to attempt a crossing of the narrow gap from the eastern Crimea Pen- insula to the Caucasus, south of the Azov sea and not far north of the Soviet naval base of NovorosSisk which frequently has been attacked by German bombers in recent days.

 The German gains in Southern Russia renewed the prospects for an Allied invasion to establish 6 second front in Europe, with the"

MOSCOW, Oct. 27.-How the tide
of battle was turned at Stalingrad a
month ago by a motorized division
which crossed the Volga in broad
daylight was related today in a dis
patch to the army newspaper Red
Star.


That was at a time when the rap
idly advancing Germans believed
the fall Of stalingrad to be only q
matter of hours.


The dispatch, by VASTLY Gross
man, said the three regiments Of the
Gen. Rodintzev's division with artil-
lery and vehicles, had made long
forced march from deep in the rear
to the banks of the Volga.


Without waiting for a compare
lively safe crossing by night, the
division passed to the west bank of
the river in barges and boats under
fierce daytime air attack.


One boat was sunk and 20 of the
10 men aboard were killed, the
dispatch said, but the remainder of
the unit completed the crossing.


The main burden Of Stalingrad's
defense was then being borne by
artillery, with German automatic
gunners attacking the batteries.


The Rodintzev division, which
previously had fought near Kiev,
battled its way out of encircle-
ment several times and went into
action while its rear guard still was
on the east bank Of the river and
its headquarters only yards from
the stream on the west bank.


One regiment was isolated, but

political reasons. In fact, his repeated
insistence on the second front is indis-
putable evidence that he does not accept
these military arguments.


I believe that the phrase ""any other

to the Axis powers, but to us-perhaps
England more than America, but never

They asked Charlottesville, Va, authorities te find man named ""Dobertov,"" who according to one of the notes found in Krivitsky's room in Krivitsky's hand writing provided him with the revolver that ended his life.

 The door to Krivitsky's fifth floor hotel room was locked but anyone with a pass key could have opened it. A chambermaid did so when she received no response to her knock. She called hotel officials after finding the body.

 There was no ledge on the outside of the building along which an as- Sassin could heve crept to enter the window. Nor is there fire escape The possibility of anyone having descended to the window by a rope from a room above was not believed likely.

 Waldman, who never doubted that KriNtsky's past was as he repre- sented it, said that the Russian secret police had samples of Krivit- sky'S hand writing in all languages and could have easily forged the notes. The authenticity of Krivit- sky's past had been certified by Trotsky and other eXiled and dis sident Communists, but American Communists had always insisted that was an imposter, a Viennese who had never any connections with Soviet Russia.

 Krivitsky's body was found in his room in the Bellevue hotel, near the Capitol, yesterday morning.

 All of which. in retrospect, may be more amusing than important, but it leads up to question which never ceases to puzzle news men, no matter how many years grown grey at the typewriter namely, why distinguished states men issue diplomatic denials which they know are certain to be dis proved later.

 STIMSON DENIES

 Many years ago, when Henry l.. Stimson was Secretary of State in the Hoover Administration, I had an interesting talk with him about this question.

 had reported, during our crisis with Japan over Man chuckuO, that the governments of Chile and Mexico had offered us naval cooperation in case of war. StimsOn stood up in his press conference a few hours la- ter and denied the story cate- gOrically.

 That evening, however, he called me to his home, sat down in front of an open fire, and ex- plained that he had to deny the story because he feared Chile and Mexico would be indignant over the leak. Chile and Mexico are countries, probably not as sensi- tive as MT. StimSon thought, but I could understand the denial. Per- haps he was right.

 But I never could understand the denial, after Pearl HarbOr, of our losses there. Even three months later, after the Japs had circulated exact details of the losses through Latin America obviously knew whatt hey were talking about - even then the President came out. in his Feb. 22 speech, unequivOcalIy deny ing that there had been losses worth worrying about at Pearl HarbOr

 With lot of people, this only undermined confidence in future statements by Roosevelt and his Administration and loss of public confidence can be even more Serioust han losing battle ships.

 THE DENIAL SCORE CARD

 Just for amusement, the already overworked girls in my office have got up a list of fairly important Merry -Go-Round stories which were indignantly, categorically. vehemently denied but later turned out to be true. Here they are:

Four years ago, be- fore this country got into the war. said Langer, Dunn blocked the entry into the United States for some 651 refugees from Nazi Germany, and furthermore he later sent a cable to the U. s. Minister in Switzerland, ordering him not to send back to this country reports on Nazi atro- cities. Those are pretty serious &C., cusationS which, if true, would make Secretary Dunn not only pro-Nazi but anti-Semitic.

 The story of the 651 refugees is one of the sad stories of the war. It wasn't G5l, the way, but 2,0O0 who got visas to come to the United States after they had been checked and okayed by the Department of Justice as desirable citizens. Nearly all of them were in special danger because they held political positions. Few of them got out of Nazi terri tory but in negotiating for their re- moval to this country by the War Refugee Board, a number of cables had to be cleared through the De- partment of State. James c. Dunn, as head of the division of Western European affairs at that time, initialed many of the cables to expe- dite them, though this was not di- rectly his business.

 CODE ENDANGERED

 There came time, however when messages from these refugees, trans mitted through Switzerland present. ed threat to break the American secret codes. Any code can be broken If the uncoded contents of mess age are known and compared with the coded version of that same message. For this reason, a cable was sent to the U s. Minister in Switzerland. ordering him not to use the code for refugee messages. The story got out that this was an order to stop sending atrocity re- ports to the United States. but actu- ally 1t was nothing more than an order to safeguard the code. Jimmy Dunn got blamed for it, but actually the order seems to have been cabled to Switzerland over the signature of Sumner Welles, thu Under Sec retary of State.

 Perhaps better case man be made tEat Dunn has been pro- Com munist than that he is pro-Fascist. At the beginning of U. s. participa- tion in the war, British and Amer ican governments agreed to a full exchange of information on all sub JectS. Dunn is generally given credit for having broadened that policy into one of full exchange of inform at!on with Soviet Russia, too. Before the Moscow government had been treated with suspicion and caution. Treating Moscow with confidence and respect as an equal was a new idea. It paid of when Hull went to Russia for his conference with Stalin and Molotov and came home with the Moscow agreement. Dunn wetn along on that trip, as Hull's adviser.

 NO SILVER SPOON

 When Dunn hasn't been criticized for his policies, he has been picked on because he married money an Armour heiress or because he was once in charge of protocol at White House and State Department func- anu Ndo IDiISldCj SNl an expert at balancing tea cups. But all such stuff is a far cry from his origin and he is anything but Q Harvard -Groton silk stocking, which all successful diplomats are sup posed to be. Jimmy Dunn was born in Newark and his father was plumber

 He studied a little law and some architecture but holds no degrees for graduating in either trade, though he did work as an architect from 1912 to 1917. Tn the war he was a naval lieutenant, serving as aide to the naval attachc at Ha- vana. That turned him to diplomacy and he began at the bottom. as clerk in the Department in 1919 He has been career diplomat ever since, with the exception of year out in 193O and '3l during the serious illness Of his wife. It was his g years of experience that probably accounts most for his assistant sec retaryship in charge of eastern hemisphere affairs. one of the hot test postwar spcss in government."

the Reich might be necessary.


Most military observers wish
they had more definite informa-
ton about what is happening on
the eastern front. They would
like to know whether the Nazi
forces are being routed or are
rereating in order.


The Russians are prone to ex-
aggerate the number of Germans
they have killed. At one time
last year we had been accustomed
to reading in their official state
ments about tens of thousands OF
Nazis killed over a period of a
few days.


Until yesterdays Soviet COM
munique reported that $4,000
Germans were killed in the battle
for Taganrog, the number of
casualties listed by the Russians
seldom exceeded four figures and
the number Of Nazi tanks and
planes reported destroyed and
damaged was kept to a modest
average.


The Nazis in their commune
ques speak about bitter fights Of
their famous SIS corps, grenadiers
and aviation. But there is little
which would indicate that the
fighting consists Of more than
relatively strong rear-guard ac-
tions.


Shortened Lines Would Aid.


In the battle for Stalingrad the
Nazis lost whole armies with
their complete equipment. No
such reverses have been reported
In recent weeks, although the
Germans have two-thirds OF their
forces opposing the Russians on
the eastern front.


BY a complicated process of
calculation and deduction, 1t ap-
pears that the Germans have
lost In their present defensive
fight not more than 100000 men
killed, wounded or captured. This
Is less than 7 per cent OF their
estimated strength In that area.


Should they succeed in holding
Smolensk the Nazis are likely to
take a line along the Dnieper
River. This is q much shorter
position than heretofore and can
be held with approximately 100
divisions much closer to their
supply base than when they were
extended to the Don River.

Commissar Molotov on the twenty
eighth anniversary celebration Of
the October revolution will be over
shadowed in the eyes of the world
by the failure of Premier Stain to
make any appearance on that his
toric occasion. Nevertheless, it was
an important speech and it deserves
careful consideration.


There has been no statement of
the reason for Stalin's failure to
participate in the observance of the
day which, in Russia, is comparable
to our own Fourth of July. In view
OF the fact, however. that the Rus
slams this year are also celebrating
the victory over the Fascist powers
it is certain that only the most
compelling reasons could have pre-
vented the generalissimo from max
ing an appearance. The natural
supposition is that the rumors OF
his serious illness are we'll founded,
yet this, until there has been some
authoritative announcement, must
remain matter of conjecture. The
only thing of which we may be
sure is that Mr.. Molotov, presumably
acting as Stalin's spokesman, has
made statement of Soviet policy
which challenges the attention of
the world.


1t is clear, from his statement,
that the Soviet government remains
dissatisfied with the arrangement
for Allied control of Japan, and,
judging from his remarks, there
seems to be little prospect that the
Russians will take part In the cur
rent discussions of the Far Eastern
Advisory Commission. This stands
in contrast to last weeks statement
by President Truman that he ex-
pected Russia to join the commission
at an early date.


Mr.. Molotov also discussed for the
first time the matter OF the atomic
bomb, and 1t is difficult not to read
into his remarks a protest against
the Anglo-American decision to
withhold the production secrets in
volved in the manufacture of the
bomb. On the whole, however, the
speech of the Foreign Commissar
was moderate in tone.


Disclaiming any desire for venge-
ance, he said that in the judgment
of the Soviet authorities ""it is not
past wrongs that should actuate us,
but the interests of safeguarding
peace and security for the nations
in the postwar period"" And to this
| he added: The Soviet Union has

This may mean much or little.
But it seems to carry an implicit
invitation which should be acted
upon. AS OF today the greatest
obstacle to security. or at least to a
sensesof security. lies in the failure
to develop any real safeguard against
the aggressive use Of atomic weapons.
We know that Russia, given tir~e,
can develop her own atomic weapons,
and Mr.. Molotov implies that that
will be done. In this situation, COM
mon sense would indicate the de-
STABILITY of sharing our ""know-how'
secrets, conditioned upon an ar
rangement for international inspec-
ton which would guard against
secret preparation in any country for
surprise attack. Mr.. Molotov's words
may indicate that Russia now is
ready to entertain such proposal.
In any event, the possibility should
be explored, and explored now."

But at least he deliv- cred up some plain and candid talk, a commodity which at times has seemed to be rationed in the District of Colum- bia. MT. ByrneS brought the current picture of our national economy into proper focus, avoiding the rosy light of our August optimism and the deep Shad- owS of panicky December despair. In that focus first things came first. Recon version, long overemphaSized, was not condemned or blacked out, but scaled in proper proportion to the paramount need of war production. Mobilization and manpower, Stabilization and imitation, taxes, labor relations, agriculture, con- tract termination, surplus property - these and other war-born or War-aggra- yated problems received generally forth right treatment. In fact, MT. Byrnes touched on almost every vexing subject except foreign relations.

 And that subject was taken up by Pres ident Roosevelt at his press conference that day after the ByrneS report was made public What the President said was comforting, in a general sort of way. He was arch and bantering with the aS- sembled press, as is his frequent custom.

 He told the reporters that differences among the great powers, important or unimportant, were necessary. He said there was no way to bring Russia, Britain and the United States any closer except to install their governments in con- mon capital. He suggested that one should avoid loud talk on differing lrl- Depreciation of common principles of pol icy, just as one should avoid loud talk. about a persons individual interpreta- ton of the Ten Commandments. But he did not reveal any specific reactions to recent specific crises in Europe. Premier Stalin has been specific on occasion, notably in regard to YugoSlavia and Po- land. Prime Minister Churchill has gwen detailed explanations of his position on variety of matter, from liquidation of the British Empire to the makeup of Italian government and the civil war in Greece.

 In the wake of this there has grown up in this country an urgent desire for loud talk"" which has transcended domestic politics and crossed party and intra-party lines. More recently urgent demands for specific statements on American policy have come from Britain. Perhaps MT. Roosevelt's silence and apparent lack Of concern conceal plan of his own for re- conciling admitted differences at the coming meeting of the Big Three. Per haps his special information leads him to believe that the general anxiety is un- necessary. But in either case the publics obvious desire for little plain talk of the Byrnes variety does not seem unrea- Eonable."

German Defeat Creates Problems Linked 10

 Conference Task",By John M. HightOwer Associated Press CorrespondenD,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 8.-Sec- retary of State Stettinius said today the end of the war in Europe has given new urgency to the work of the Conference of United Nations"" {""

 In an address prepared for radio delivery, Stettinius said that Ameri- can dead and wounded in the war have given us one more chance to build world order free from war""

 He added:

 We remember also that Germany has been defeated only because the United Nations joined their strength in the common cause, and that last ing peace will be possible only if they unite their strength

 In radio talk to Canada, Prime Minister Mackenzie King said that The end of warfare in Europe is not the end of the war - there is still another enemy. The United Nations have still to bring about the unconditional surrender of Japan""

 Out of the fires of war;"" MacKen- zie King said, The San Francisco Conference has begun to forge and to fashion mighty instrument for world security

 SAN FRANCISCO, May 8 = A meeting of President Truman, Prime Minister Churchill and Pre- mier Stalin is expected by United Nations diplomats to be arranged soon after VIE Day.

 It is believed here that only a gathering of the Big Three probably somewhere in the Euro pean area-can solve some of the urgent problems now arising from the total defeat of Germany and lay the basic plans for restoring civil order and real peace to Europe

 These are regarded as problems linked closely to the job, being rushed forward by the United Ma tions Conference, of creating per- manent organization to maintain peace and security throughout the world

 The immediate impact of the ending of the European war is to reinforce demands of Secretary Stettinius, Foreign Minister Eden, Russian Commissar Molotov and other leaders that the conference lose no time in finishing the task.

 Meanwhile, VIE Day found rank ing diplomats of the big powers agreed on another big matter in addition to the general security system. This is that the powers should take separate but related measures to make sure that for the next half century or so Germany will be denied the resources and industrial development necessary to plunge the world into another war

 The big powers have set up ma chinery for keeping firm grasp on conference progress by making sure of their own unity on all fu- ture issues. The Big Four"" became the Big Five"" yesterday when Foreign Minister Bidault of France joined the almost daily sessions in Stettinius' penthouse apartment. The first reported action of the five was to set up subcommittee of world organization experts to study and report on all amend ments put forward by the smaller nation delegation.

 Limits Proposed

 Many of the smaller nations have proposed changes in the security council which would limit the au- thority of the five powers that would hold permanently five of it's eleven seats. But Molotov made it clear at a news conference yes terday that the big nations look for no such amendments to go through.

 He described as noteworthy"" the fact that of the p amendment"

Ocean and the South Pacific are likely
to be the scenes of the most spectacular
air and sea battles yet fought in this
war when the Nazi-Japanese offensive
in those areas begins, probably within
the next few weeks.


Unless the American Australian forces
In the South Pacific succeed by drastic
steps in holding back the japanese, the
much-feared synchronized offensives of
the two principal Axis partners will be
a fact, with the Japs launching their
main attack on India and the Nazis at
tempting to join hands with them
through the Near East.


1t seems doubtful, from available re-
ports, that the Russians can prevent
the Germans from reaching their OBJ
iectives-the Caucasian oil fields, the
Caspian Sea and Stalingrad. The best
the Russians can do is economic their
forces and remain on the defensive until
fresh war material arrives to enable
their vast manpower to start anew their
fight against the enemy. Hope fingers
in some quarters that Marshal Semeon
Timoshenko's forces will be able to stop
the Nazis short of their objectives, but
high-ranking military experts do not
seriously believe this will happen. They
hope for the best and fear the worst.


Nazi preparations for a campaign
against the Suez Canal and the Near
East are nearly complete. Egypt's torrid
temperatures are now subsiding some
what. The Nazis have already begun to
move large numbers Of planes and inn
portant army units to Greece and the
Islands of the Aegean and important re-
tnforcements have reached Field Mar
shal Erwin Rommel. The Nazi i-controlled
ports OF the Black Sea are humming
with activity.


Could Repair Novorossisk.


Although the Russian Black Sea port
Of Novorossisk will unquestionably be
heavily damaged by the time the Ger
mans march in, the Nazis probably will
be able to repair the worst parts of it
within few months.


Marshal Rommel has managed to get
his reinforcements across the Mediter-
ranean in spite of the determined at
tacks of the American and British air
force and British cruisers and sub
marines. Moreover, 1t is expected that
when ""der tag"" arrives the French gov
ernment will not object to the Nazis
using French bases on both sides of
the Mediterranean. French Chief Of
Government Pierre Laval ID pledged to
policy OF colhborat ton With Berlin and
would do Anything IN liis power. to please
his Nazi masters. provided they let him
keep his ONCE.


1t is not easy to determine how many
men and how much war material and
other vital supplies the Nazis have
gotten across the Mediterranean, but
Allied military men are worried. The
reinforcements which the United Ma
tions are sending the new commander
in chief, Gen. Sir Harold Alexander,
must travel $4,000 miles before they
reach the Red Sea, while the Nazis are
only few hundred miles from the
future theater of operations


The danger to Egypt is not under
estimated, neither is the Importance of
retaining possession of that territory,
regardless of the price. The Allies will
spare no effort to prevent Marshal ROM
mel from advancing further and the
test of whether powerful aviation really
can check the progress of an army only
supported by aviation will be applied


New Strategy Foreseen.


We already have powerful air force
In that area and more planes are being
ferried across every day. But it is
doubted that Marshal Rommels army
will be used as single steam roller as
was the case few weeks ago. The
Nazis probably will allow their desert
general to open the attack, while other
drives develop against Syria and Turkey
where the Allies are less well supplied
with modern war equipment.


The Near East is regarded in Wash.
ington as the paramount front in the
entire East No effort is being spared tt
make the Nazis' task impossible, but dis
tances are against us. The actua
strength OF the United Nations in thai
area is not known, however, and may
be greater than most people imagine.


While everything humanly possible il
being done now to defend the Near East
an equally serious situation is expected
to arise in the Indian Ocean. The
monsoon rains will end some time early
next month.


Before our reconquest of the Solomon
Islands the japanese had been sending

 This report was preceded last mid- night by official accounts of earlier fierce tank and infantry actions southwest of Stalingrad. In that fighting, the Germans succeeded in capturing a village, but did not hold 1t long. A Russian counter-attack took it back, killed hundreds ot Germans and destroyed seven tanks.

 On an adjacent sector. seven more German tanks were disabled, and one Russian lieutenant knocked out six additional tanks with an anti tank rife.

closer and more searching discus

decisions on incomplete data at a
breakneck speed"" This accords with
the inconclusive results attained at
the Dumbarton Oaks conference to
show that much remains to be done
before def1nitive understanding is
arrived at between the western
powers and the Soviet Union.


AS usual, Mr.. Churchill gave out
factual data previously unrevealed.
He discloses, for instance, that the
Anglo-American armies on the con-

 of consolidating the two pictures.

 However, a detailed dispatch by Henry Shapiro, United Press staff correspondent in Moscow describing his personal experiences during the air attack seemed to indicate that the raid was only of moderate in- tensity compared with the smashing blows which the German air force has in the past dealt at British cities.

 The Nazi high command said that the Moscow attack had started huge fires near the Kremltn and the Moscow river which weaves through the center of the Russian capital and that damage was caused to Red Army headquarters and gov- ernment buildings.

 The attack was called & ""repris- al"" for Soviet air attacks on Hel- sinki and Bucharest-the customary Nazi propaganda technique. Most of the worst German attacks on Britain have been officially charac- terized as ""reprisals"" for some act or other by the British.

 The Nazi high command also en- tered an even more sweeping claim than any before concerning the disintegration of Russian defenses. No unified front line or central Russian command is any longer in existence, the Germans claimed, maintaining that their forces are now engaged in mopping up scat- tered and isolated Russian detach- mentS.

 Moscow sharply challenged this report but estimated that 200 Ger man planes participated.

 Front Lines Forgotten

 The air attack diverted attention from front-line fighting between Russia and Germany. Neither Berlin nor Moscow indicated any appre- ciable changes in the front posi- tionS.

 The Germans claimed that the smash by air. at the Red capital was one phase of terrific assault by the Luftwaffe on the entire triangle from Snolensk to Leningrad to Moscow.

 In that area, 1t was claimed, Ger man palneS wrecked railroad lines, military barracks and pounded troop concentrations in an obvious att tempt to break up Soviet military power behind the firing lines to pre- vent reinforcement of front-ltne Red divisions.

 The rail on Moscow as said in Berlin to have included the drop ping of hundreds of heavy high ex- plosive bombs and tens of thou sands of incendiaries which, 1t was claimed, started big fires through out the Soviet capital. Twelve hits by heavy bombs were said to have been observed near the Kremlin, massive nerve center of the Russian state, and 20 large fires were spotted, German airmen said, east of the Kremlin Railroads running east to- ward the urals from Moscow were heavily attacked.

 The Russian accounts said that several fires were started by in- cendiary bombs in central Mos COW and that some casualties had occurred but insisted that little damage resulted. Some 17 German radiers were reported brought down in the attack which started at 70 o'clock last night and continued until 3:30 this morning.

 One bomb was dropped in Man ege Square, directly in front of the U. s. embassy. Some reporters claimed that the crater of this bomb was the only one they had observed in Moscow.

 Only Few Got Through

 The Russians insisted that only a few of the German raiding planes penetrated to the Russian capital because of the stiffness of the So- viet defenSeS.

 It was reported in Moscow that the German air force for two days has been attempting to attack Lem ingrad. It was said 19 German planes have been brought down in their attempted raids with 8 loss of four Russian machines.

 On the front lines the Russians reported that their lines appeared to be holding well in the fre- quently mentioned PSkov. Polotsk- Nevel, and Novograd Volynsk sec tors, protecting Leningrad, Mos- COW and Kiev.

 The Russian communique named no new towns and indicated that German attempts to break through in these regions have failed.

 The Germans had little more to say about front line fighting. They claimed that the German army is concentrating at the moment in cleaning up encircled Soviet troops and is not pressing its advance SO strongly.

 One Nazi report claimed that Ja- kob Stalin, son of the Russian pre-. mier, had been captured with his Panzer unit southeast Of Vitebsk.

 Another Nazi report said that large numbers of ""communiSts and Jews"" had been executed in Jugo. slavia, c possible indication Of pan. Slavic demonstrations in shis strongly pro-ieuaaian Balkan state.

 Yet, Communist-inf influenced attempts to justify the attempted ravishment of a thriving, democratic nation are still ob- vious in the United States.

In the United States, the press is free. People may write and say what they like. By the weight of their own absurdity, arguments such as these collapse.

 Business charts and statistics aren't always the best evidence. But if they sometimes fail to tell the whole story, they usually point, at least, to the truth. Anybody who has been doubting whether Finland has really been going places dur ing the 20 years of its independence might take glance at few figures, based on the statistical report of the League of Nations.

 Like most Moscow banquets for foreign dignitaries, the dinner was followed by long series of toasts. The speakers were introduced by Foreign Minister Molotoff, four interpreters scrubbed in notebooks, later translated into Russian or English.

 The thirtieth toast that evening fell to Joe Barnes, former news paper correspondent in Russia, now with the Office of War Informa- ton. and one of Willkie's advisers on the trip. The toasts had been long and were dragging. Barnes de- cided it was time to wake people up.

 So he spoke in Russian. It was the first time in the history Of these formal banquets that a vis- iting American or Englishman re- piled in Russian and it brought down the house. Stalin himself led the applause.

 Then Barnes turned to the in- terpreters and signaled for them to interpret in English. They were confused. So Stalin suggested that Barnes translate his own speech into his native tongue, which was naturally easy for him, and he did."

 Relations among allies have been headache since military history was first daubed on a caveman's wall, headache that, like a defer red pain, often appears where least expected. When 1t appears in rela- tions with the Britinsh, treatment is delicate, for reason not gener- ally comprehended.

 OR FIGHT ALONE

 We have more in common with the British than with any of our Allies and depend more upon them. If they go out of the war, the war comes to America.

 But, while informed opinion here holds that Russia will stick in the war as long as Stalin sticks in the Kremlin - ie., indefinitely yet about Britain there turks in the mind of responsible authori- ties this question: If Churchill falls, who succeeds him?

 Some appeaserp And then, how long will Britain stickp So the President goes far to satisfy Britain'S one inspiring popular leader. Which means, sometimes, pretty far, for the Prime Minister is still an amateur strategist and likes to influence Allied strategy.

 Before last December Churchill said: Give us the tools; we'll do the job"" At that time we could spare them a good deal of lend- lease aid. But Pearl Harbor also meant Singapore; the job had doubled; the demand for tools had quadrupled. Also the demand on British manpower. And the very moment they needed more arms, SO did we.

Finally, he was arrested in France in
1908, on the request of the Russian Sc

he was allowed to go to England, where
he spent the next decade.


During his years in England he con-
Quoted revolutionary work and in time
became secretary of the London group
of Bolsheviks. While there, too, he
married the niece, Ivy. of Sir Sidney
Low, a well-known British publicist.


Refused Status by Britain.


When Bolshevik power was estab-
lished in Russia, Litvinoff was named
as the new states diplomatic representa-
tive in London. Britain. however, re-
fused to grant him full diplomatic status
and he remained there for some time in
an uncertain capacity. At the same
time, r. H. Bruce Lockhart, who has
memorialized his experience in British
Agent"" was in similar position in Mos
COW. Neither was fully accredited Dip
lomat, but each sought to maintain re-
lations between the two estranged states.
Finally, after the attempted assassina-
ton of Latin, the Bolsheviks arrested
Lockhart. The British countered by
jailing Litvinoff. Eventually, the two
were exchanged, like prisoners Of war.


After his return to Moscow, Litvinon
was named to the Collegium on Foreign
Affairs and served until 1880 under
George Cricherin, foreign minister, whom
he succeeded. AS a matter Of fact, Lit
vinoff has been the executor Of Russian
foreign policy even longer, for during
his last two or three years in office Chi
cherin was so i'll that he was rarely
able to work more than few hours at
q time.


When Litvinoff assumed control Of
Soviet foreign relations, Russia was an
outcast nation. He has always been
forced to work between two f1res-reac-
ton abroad and mistrust at home. He
was responsible for his every act to an
oligarchy-the Politbureau, composed of
zealots with little understanding of di-
plomacy or conditions abroad-who ex-
pected him to forward Russia's national
interests while never compromising the
very Communist principles which caused
other nations to hate and fear Moscow.
It was difficult and thankless task.


Advanced Russja's Interest.


r. orIc
Litvinoff has done an excellent job for
Russia. Today Moscow has formal diplo-
matte relations with virtually every
world power. It has favorable CONNER
cial relations with many of them. It is
a member of the League of Nations. It
is bound by an alliance to the greatest
continental democracy-France. And
If Russia is willing to make certain
changes and concessions In its original
proposal which would limit British re-
sponsibility to defend the Soviet in the
Far East-it may yet sign treaty with
London.


Molotoff, for many years president Of
the Council of Peoples Commissars-the
equivalent of premier in European
parliamentary government-is one Of
Stalin's intimates and sits on the ALL
powerful Politbureau, or steering COM
mittee, of the Communist party. The
Politbureau, dominated by Stain, is the
real Russian government No action of
importance is ever taken without its
consent.


The new foreign minister, however,
knows little at first hand about foreign
affairs. His main field Of activity has
been domestic. In essence, what Molo-
toff's appointment means Is that the
Politbureau will take direct charge Of
Soviet foreign relations and that the

 Moscow, September 9. - (UP) - Soviet Guard troops today were reported to hava smashed Nazi positions in one district of Stalingrad and to have driven them back a mile and a quarter in a fierce charge through the city streets. The Red Army newspaper Red Star said that crack guard attachments of the army smashed through barriers set up by the Germans within Stal- tngrad.

 e The guard attachments then droYa forward, exposing the flank Of an enemy infantry unit, the report saAa. The attack was one of several in various sectors of the Stalingrad front in which Soviet forces pushed back the NaziS.

 Red Star singled out a Soviet tank unit commanded by Lieuten- ant Colonel Bubnev for special men, ton, reporting the detachment had destroyed 233 German tanks, 68 cal1- non and thousands"" of Nazi troops in continuous fighting since August 4.

 Tn four battles fought in single day the unit destroyed 3S tanks and IS cannon with a loss of three Rus sian machines, Red Star said.

 BlOOdy Fighting

 Red Star reported that bloody fighting was in progress at every point where Nazi forces have pene- trated, the outskirts of Stalingrad. Frequently, 1t said, the Russians occupy one portion of house ana the Nazis the other and battle for possession with rifles. bayonets, hand grenades. and naming benzine bottles.

 The Germans were said to be bringing up steady stream of rein- forcementS by transport planes rushing the men into battle.

 The newspaper Bolshevik report- ed that Soviet armored trains steam along the front, blasting key Nazt positions. One attack by an armor- ed train was directed against q Nazi-occupied railroad station ands with the aid of Soviet infantry, the Russians managed to capture lS tanks and many German cannons.

 For the first time in days Soviet dispatches from the embattled VoAga city indicated that the Russians were regaining, in part and poss1- bly, temporarily, the initiative on several portions of the front.

 Using machine guns, hand gren- ades and even rifle butts, the S0-s viets were described as batterino their way into Nazi-held buildings and exterminating the German troops, rooa.s by room.

 Most of Stalingrad was in rlaiTf or ahlaze from the constant rain of German fire and explosive bombs and heavy artillery shells.

 Determined to Hold

 There was every indication here that the Russian commanders are determined to hold Stalingrad what ever the cost.

 The Russians, 1t was reported, still hold certain lines of communi- cation to Stalingrad although they are slow and difficult and the Soviet high command was said to be talk ing drastic steps to reinforce the garrison of the beleaguered city.

 The new Red air fleet units op- erating in defense of Stalngrad were said to be not strong enough to challenge the huge German air superiority on the front.

 However, they were able to give sufficient support to enable the Rus- sian land forces to cling to their positions at most points despite the systematic bombardment of one sec tor after another by the luftwaffe.

 Soviet fighters were reported con- stantly intercepting large forma- tions of German bombers. One AoI+o,. ,,v.S& ,,,oe vayHoa.fad &a hava shot down ST bombers in a days fighting with a loss of only seven planes.

 The Germans, dispatches said, marked off Soviet positions in squares. Then, hundreds of bomb CTS systematically dropped thou sands of explosive and fragmenta- ton bombs in an effort to destroy every living thing and clear a road to Stalingrad.

 Evidently this effort, the most vio- lent of the supreme German at tempt to take Stalingrad and cut {, the Volga river line, began yeSter- day. The Russians chung to the ground as the bombers roared over. Then column after column of Ger man tanks and infantry tried to surge toward Stalingrad.

nection with the Tribute to Russia Day
on June %, which, as you know, is the
second anniversary of the invasion of
Russia by the German Army.


We hope that at least. $4,000 Washing

The more personal these letters are
the better They might talk about
where and how the writer's are living,
what they are thinking about, perhaps
how they felt when Stalingrad held day
after day, or what they thought when
Stain gave the noW-famous order dis
solving the Comintern. Anything that
interests the writer will be of interest
to the Russian people.


When these letters reach Russia they
will be translated into Russian and
sent to some particular person who will
be glad to hear from an unknown
friend. These letters will assist in bring
ing about better understanding be-
tween the Russian and the American
people.


Each letter should be signed with
the name and the address, so that the
writer may hope for reply. The trans
lation of the letters into Russian will be
done after they reach Russia. They can
be written on one or both sides of
single sheet Of paper and should be
sent, without envelopes, to Russian War

NEW YORK, Jan. l7.-Counsel
for Earl Browder moved unsuccess-
fully today for a modification of
the indictment against him as the
Communist leaders trial on pass
port fraud charges opened in Fed
eral Court.


George Gordon Battle, Browder's
attorney, argued that two of the
three names under which Browder
was accused Of having obtained
passports were. superfluous, mas.
much as he was asked only the
""last"" name he had used wnen he
applied for a fourth passport in
1887.


In the indictment he is charged
with having masqueraded as Mich

Albert Richards.


Judge Alfred G. Coke denied the
motion to throw out the first two
names.


Name Stops Judge.


Before impaneling a jury Judge
Coke read a long list of questions
to be asked of the prospective jur-
ors, list which he remarked ""be-
gins to read like a statute of the
United States""


Among the questions was one ask
ing whether the veniremen were
considered to be ""Stalinists, Trots-

and said:

with obtaining and using a passport

MOSCOW, Jan. 1.-Leaving
the Kalmyck capital of Elista far
in it's rear, the Red Army has
driven to the shores of the great
lake east of Salsk in an offensive
aimed directly at the Caucasus
after trapping % divisions at
Stalingrad and killing or cap
turing 312,650 of the enemy, the
Russians reported today.


The rush to the shores of the
great lake, now frozen and covered
with snow, carried the Russian
troops to point about 40 miles
southwest of Elista in the biggest
single days jump of the offensive
below Stalingrad.


The Russian winter campaigns
thus had put the Germans forces
in the Caucasus in an increasingly
dangerous position after building a
wall 81 miles thick at its narrowest
point around the % German divi-
sions trapped at StaHnsrad.


The advance point reached yes
terday, a Soviet communiaue dis
closed, was Priyutnoe, about AZ
miles south of Remontnoe, which
was taken the previous day.


Garrison Virtually Encircled.


The German garrison at Elista was
virtually encircled, with the Rus
slams having passed by both on the
south and the north.


The lake spreads northwest to the
approaches of Salsk, only about 90
miles away, and its frozen surface
1t was believed, would facilitate the
Russians advance at this season.


Salsk is key point of the railway
system south of the Don 1t is on
the Stalingrad- -Tikhoretsk railway
and junction point for connect
ing line to Rostov Consequently it
was of Importance in maintaining
the connection between the Ger
mans in the Caucasus and in the
Ukraine.


Twenty miles south of Phiyutnoe
is Divnoe, the starting point of an
other railway linked with the
Rostov-Baku trunk line. An ad-
vance along that line would threaten
isolation of the German forces
buried deep in the Mozdok and
Nalchik sectors of the Caucasus.


Another dangerous bend had beer
created for the Germans further
north along the Doh, where thei,
TANKS were menaced by two Red
Army salients southwest of Stain
grad through Kotelnikovski and
west Of Stalingrad to the Millerovc

Germans tried to put all their troops over
the river and move into Voronezh, on the
Voronezh River. Here is the narrow pas
sage on which the Germans stake much

German ambition.

 On Crimea Farley Actions",BY LYLE c. WILSON,"Washington, March - (UP)- President Roosevelt seemed today to have the support of substantial majority of House and Senate for his Crimea conference actions and the ultimate international security organization.

 His conference report to Q joint session of Congress yesterday was received with more attention than applause. But subsequent congress sional comment indicated that he could expect strong Republican as well as Democratic support for his general objectives.

 The president will report again on the conference today when he meets reporters in regularly sched- uled press conference. But he is expected to tell them little beyond what already mas been published. One thing he may clear up is the matter of his conference in AleXan- dria, Egypt, with Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

 There have been so many and such conflicting official versions of what they discussed that MT. Roose- Welt may wish to tell about 1t in his own words. The confusion arises over the question whether the two statesmen did or did not discuss the Pacific war at Alexandria.

 The president was unable to ob- tain from Congress a unanimous vote of confidence such as Church i'll got in the House of Commons Some Republicans and some Demo- cratS were critical of the Crimea re- port. But experienced congression- al observers believe there Is def mite trend toward forceful postwar peace guarantees such as Marshal Josef V. Stalin, Churchill and MT. Roosevelt have been discussing.

 There is some congressional dis appointment that the president does not take the legislative branch further into his confidence. There is fear that some of the secrets withheld from Congress are of greater political than military sig nificance. But aside from tho question of Poland there has not developed any direct challenge to the Crimea agreements.

 POLES, GREEKS WRITE IN

 Treatement of the liberated areas. particularly Poland and Greece. Min ority nationality groups, natural iZed American citizens who were born in those countries, or the chil- dren of such immigrants, took the lead in those pressure campaigns. Many Polish Americans were organ ized in support of the London gov ernment. There has not yet been time to register any expression of opinion over the settlement of the Polish question by the Crimea con- ference of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin. But since many U. s. Poles BoVe their money to support the London government and since the Polish government in London haG protested the Crimea settlement, it is probable thta similar protest will be felt here.

 The GreeK affair got a little diff"" ferent reaction. Not only the Greek. Americans protested what happened in their homeland after the Ger mans were driven out, but q meas"" urable number of U. s. citizens oi non-Greek origin expressed them selves on this, too There was con- demnation of British policy in try ing to suppress the Greek patriots, and praise for Secretary of State StcttiniuS when he stated the policy of the U. s. government to be in favor of elf-determination for all liberated nations.

 The significant thing about the American public reaction to this iS- sue, however, was that 1t brought out a little revival of isolationist sentiment. Again there was the de- mand that, if this was the way the peace was going to be settled, the boys should bc brought back home.

 Dumbarton Oaks plans for lasting peace organization - is to. day by long odds the subject that interests most U. s, citizens who voluntarily write in to give the De- their advice. Fan mail on this sub 1ect has had an interesting evolu- tion.

 WOMEN BRING PRESSURE

 Last May there were great many letters from influential women, writing in to demand the creation of world organization to maintain peace. It was an organized campaign Carrie Chapman Catt, head of the Committee on the Cause and Cure for War which had maintained a lobby in Washington for over ten years, was leader In this group were the Y. w. c. A., the League of Women Voters. Business and Pro- fessional Women's organization, Ma tional Federation of Women's Clubs and others. Before the war they were interventionist in aim. Under a new name of The Women's Ac- ton Committee for Victory and Lasting Peace, some of these organ izations are again active, this time to bring pressure for adoption of the Dumbarton Oaks plan.

 Today there is measurable and voluntary expression of opinion fav- bring the creation of a World Police Force to maintain peace in the fu- ture and similar expression in favor of severe treatment of Ger many Both of which are considered significant at this stage of the war."

 Hand to hand fighting continued, over the bodies of the dead and the debris of tanks, guns, trucks and wrecked buildings.

 From House to House

 Small groups of sub-machine gunners followed up each lombard ment, moving from house to house and after them came infantrymen and engineers who fortified such houses as had escaped destruction.

 Both sides used light mortars and small calibre guns emplaced be- hind the walls of partly wrecked houses or in windows.

 Thousands of men perished under the debris of burned buildings and dispatches said that the streets and sidewalks were strewn with bodies.

 The Germans attacked ferocious- ly throughout the day, often retir- ing at night and reattacking at dawn.

The occupa- tion of Dakar or French West Africa apparently would not sat- isfy Stalin.

 But the opposition of certain high U. s. Army Navy officers to 8 European front has been very strong indeed. There the matter rests, which is why Stalin has brought the matter so frankly and vigorously out into the open through Willkie and the Associat- ed Press.

 What the Russians have made very clear, and what most people do not realize, is that it is not merely a matter of munitions vital though that is-but also a question of keeping the Russian people alive. Russia has now lost her granaries, and millions this winter will suffer or starve. Rus sia has also lost her coal deposits and is completely cut off from her oil-while U. s. oil companies and U. s. government agencies have diskered and frittered away price less months trying to decide whether Russia should be given closed-down Texas oil refineries all because the Eig oil companies wanted to be paid royalties (even though they never too kout pa- tents in RusSia).

 Naturally, because of all this, morale is not too good i'm Russia. And the Willkie- Stalin state ments are relatively mild cOm- pared with the sentiment of the Russian people. This is what returning Ambassador Standley doubtless will report to the White House, and this is one of the big factors to be considered regarding a Second Front in Europe.

 For Stalin has his military lead- . CTS to contend with, too.

Sacrifice Alone Won't Bring Victory;
AII-Out War Hos q Higher Meaning",,"for going all-out on food seems to
call only for higher prices and less
food per capita. This program is
fich in sacrifices for many; it has
the hard feel of war about it; it
meets the oratorical conceptions of
all-out; but one questions whether
it is as genuinely all-out as a proper
national farmland plan.


Now Herbert Hoover comes along
and urges that we remove retail
price ceilings on food, letting food
prices climb as they will, to en-
courage food production. This has
great air of all-outness about it.


1t evokes vision of activity,
stir, confusion, big effort, lack of
food for many persons; it has all
the oratorical elements of about
ness. Yet, if we look closely at
the plan, we shall see that Mr..
Hoover proposes only that we do in
war precisely what we did in peace,
only with more noise and hustle;
that we pin our faith on automatic
processes and let nature and eco
nomics take their course.


Dollars VS.. Ration Tickets.


Mr.. Hoover's plan means that
the dollar becomes more important
than the ration ticket in the food
market; 1t means less food for es-
sential workers and more food for
non-essential workers and for nom
workers who happen to have the
price. The only all-out element in
the plan is the element of sacrifice.


But we must learn to separate
from genuine all-outness its Incl
dental elements of confusion, dis
location, sacrifice, hardship. These
are inevitable in going all-out, but
they do not, of themselves, prove
that we are all-out.


Here we have a second glimpse
Of what all-outness means: 1t
means a plan or it means nothing.


1t means plan, or it means
nothing. Russia showed her all
outness, not when she blew up
Dnieperopetrovsk, but when she
moved entire industries back to
the Urals. Russians showed all
outness, not when they died at
Stalingrad, but when they planned
and launched a counter offensive
from Stalingrad. England shows
all-outness, not by the skimpy
menu of the Savoy, but by the
nourishing one-shilling meals In
the chain of government factory
restaurants.


We still have great deal to
learn. We shall win this war not
by our plans alone, but by our
planning."

MOSCOW, July 31.-Armored
trains of the Red Army rolled
into the shell-torn steppes Of the
Don bend today, bringing up
fresh reinforcements for the de-
tenders who already had re-
ported checking the German
onslaught west OF Stalingrad.


The new troops were rushed
straightway into the battle which
has ragged for a week in the great
loop of the Don, front dispatches
said.


But while the Russians there were
said to be holding the Nazi advance,
even thrusting it back at some
points, the situation below Rostov
continued extremely grave, with the
Germans admittedly still able to roll
on at points south of the Don.


Dispatches from the hard-pressed
front south of Rostov and Tsim-
lyansk said the Russians had lost
further ground and reported a grave
threat developing between Bataisk,
IS miles south OF Rostov, and the
Sea of Azov.


Cavalry Deals Heavy Blow.


Although there was no indication
that the main Caucasus army OF 1t.
Gen. u. T. Kozlov yet had been
thrown into the fight, Red Star re-

Germans in fighting for bridgeheads
on both sides of the Don.

Red Army men in the Tsimlyansk
area. on the Lower Don midway
between Rostov and Stallngrad.
were said to be fighting on with
the object of annihilating the enemy
group which crossed the river""


Red Star charged that Red Army
uniforms had been used by the Ger
mans for attacks in two sectors, but
said the deception was discovered
and the attacking forces, totaling
three battalions, were wiped out.


White tabs, not worn by the Rus
slams, had been placed on the col

While Nazi vanguards sought to
smash their way into Red Army de-

 The situation, however, remained l megious in the Salsk area, 100 miles { southeast of RcStov. There, Red Star said, the Russians were wag- { ing heavy defensive battles and had lUtOpped the Germans at some points

 The Russian high command dis patched special congratulations to Inc Cossacls for their extraordinary courage, and awarded many deco- Eations.

 one Cossack unit held of an at- tack by two motorized divisions, { supported by 50 tanks and at least as many planes. Another regiment beat off uninterrupted assaults by two German regiments for three days.

 Near Kletsyakaya, the Russians were reported to have cut of a big force of German mechanized and motorized forces which penetrated their defense lines around the River Don.

 The Red army threw heavy ring around the Germans to cut of their retreat and prevent their being re- 1nSorced. Soviet planes and artil- 1ery immediately commenced to pound the Germans to death.

BRITISH PESSIMISTIC


Moscow said that Nazis were at
tempting To ram wedges into var
ious parts of the city. cutting off
one district from another in order
10 come to grips with the defenders
on a piecemeal basis.


British military experts were more
pessimistic about Stalingrad'S chanc-
es but Gen. Sir Archibald Waveli
at New Delhi, expressed belief the
Russians might hold out. He sug-
gested that the actual capture OF
Stalingrad was more a matter OF
prestige than Of military advantage
since the Germans had already
gotten into position TO interfere
with traffic along the Volga artery
and had smashed Stalingrad as an
arms production center.


Wendell L. Willkie in an exclusive
statement to the United Press staff
correspondent at Moscow, Henry
Shapiro, declared that Russia was
""unconquerable.'


ACTIONS COUNT


Expanding on his views made pub
lie over the weekend, Willkie said
that unless the United Nations give
Russia aid now the offensive power
of the Red army may be lost.


Willkie said that the opening of
a second front must be expedited
and that deeds, rather than words,
was what counted at this time
Failure to give Russia the utmost
aid, said Willkie, might have most
adverse results.


The costliness Of the bloody fight
ing on the Russian front was en-
phasiZed by summary OF Russian
communiqueS which disclosed that
$4,000 Germans have been reported
killed in Is days fighting arounC
Stalingrad. It was estimated that
the Germans have lost 100000 men
since May /.


However, Willkie estimated Rus
sian casualties at 100000 men
Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim Won

placed Russian losses at 100000

 At the time of the last Quebec meeting, August, l943, relations with Russia were on tenterhooks. The second front had not yet been pledged to Stalin, there were ru- mors that Russia might even get out of the war, and the Allied pic ture generally was not bright enough to permit the President personally to push certain Anglo American differences too far.

 Nevertheless, the Presidents mili- tary and naval men did a lot of pushing and, as a result, the last Quebec meeting was one of the most vigorous of the entire war. The sparks literally flew around the Citadel

 Now, one year later, almost ex- actly the same problems-the Far East and Burma-remain to be threshed out. And with the war going infinitely better, the inside story of the last Quebec confer ence can now be told.

Troops Land Behind Red Lines.


Speeding their drive for oil in the
Caucasus, the Germans were re-
ported landing troop-laden air
transports and dropping fresh
swarms of parachutists behind
Soviet lines in a costly expenditure
of men and machines.


In the first officially reported big
scale attempt to put air-borne
troops down in the rear Of Soviet
positions on the Caucasus battle
front, the Russians said nine of ten
big Junkers transports which landed
in one sector were set afire or
smashed and the soldiers accounted
for to the last man.


War-front dispatches said the
Nazis were showering more para
chutists behind Soviet lines after
landing groups of between 100 and
$50 along with small tanks earlier
in the week. The latest invaders
were declared exterminated or
SWl1tly rounded up.


Edge Closer to StaHngrad.


The increasing Nazi use of aerial
troops was disclosed as tank-paced
enemy spearheads drove deeper into
the North Caucasus below Rostov
and tried to edge closer to Stalingfad
from the southwest.


The Soviet noon communique said
fighting continued without letup
through the night in the four main
theaters OF action.


In one clash in the Kletskaya sec

ported the Germans were forced to
retreat after losing % tanks and
Soviet forces were credited with
killing 300 Germans and knocking
out nine tanks in another battle.


Red Army units were forced back

thrust paralleling the Rostov- Baku

North of Belaya China the threat
to Stalingrad was increased by new
German gains in the Kotelnikovski
area. There German tanks tore
holes in Soviet lines, forcing the
defenders to withdraw in several
sectors.


Red Star. in a dispatch from
Kotelnikovski, said the Germans had
taken the railway in that sector
and now were seeking to develop a
broader offensive.


Kotelnikovski is located on the

MOSCOW, Oct. 9.-The Ger
mans have carried their invasion
into the Kalmyck region, which
extends south of Stalingrad
along the Volga to the Caspian
Sea, it was reported today.


An 1zvestia dispatch from Astra-
khan, Caspian port city at the
month of the Volga, disclosed for
the first time that the enemy had
entered the Kalmyck territory, an
autonomous area along the west
side Of the river, south of Stain
grad.


This indicated developing action
on the German right flank across
the steppes between the Don and
the lower Volga.


(Elista, in the western part OF


OF the Kalmyck area, about 1870


miles west of AStrakhan, was


reported by the Germans to have


been captured several weeks ago.


Fresh Forces Overrun Streets.


Meanwhile, the Germans were re-
ported intensifying their efforts to
rip through Stalingrad's defense to
the Volga, with fresh assault forces
overrunning two streets in a north
western industrial suburb where an
earlier push had been repulsed.


Nazi artillery batteries wheeled
into line to support the vanguard
OF tanks and infantrymen. German
planes carried the bombing of the
besieged garrison into its 46th day.

on Berlin intimation that the


assault operations were to be


dropped in favor of lombard

Gated unabated fighting. For the


first time since the siege of

The army newspaper Red Star
said numerically superior enemy
forces launched a local offensive
against the workers settlement
Wednesday and finally acieved
break-through that led to the occu-
patton of two streets.


Its dispatch declared the German
aim was to break through to the
river and cut the Red Army in two,
but praised the garrison troops with
a statement that they were Defend
ing every yard of land valiantly.


Offensive operations were main
tanned by Red Army forces against
the German flank northwest of
Stalirfgrad and a fresh penetration
OF the Nazi Notifications was an
nounced.


One detachment broke into en-
emy trenches, killed about 100 Ger
mans in hand-to-hand fighting and
captured four machine-guns, three
mortars and an anti-tank gun,"" the
noon communique said.


The newspaper Izvestia pictured
the city as beacon of smoke and
flame as it neared the close of the
seventh week of siege, incessant
cannonading marking the struggle
for decision.


Meet Five or Six Attacks Daily.


Some Red Army units in the en-
battled factory settlement are called
on to meet five or six attacks daily,
IZvestia said.


The noon communique told of
one such phase. in which Soviet
troops repulsed four enemy attacks,
destroyed two tanks and wiped out
about a company of German in
fantry.""


In another sector"" it said. ""12
tanks and an enemy infantry bat
talon broke through into one street,
but were forced to retreat to their
original positions by Soviet troops,
who knocked out nine tanks and
wiped out about two companies of

The British American fleet is
superior to the Italian Navy not
only in quality, but in numbers.


Hence, it Is expected that the
Germans will give us much trou-
BILE in Tunisia. Their prospects
of being able to withdraw more
than a handful Of generals and
possibly some S. S. units which
could be taken to Sicily in sub
marine transports are small. The
battle for Tunisia must end with
another Stalingrad and not an
other Dunkerque.


Military observers here believe
the battle for Tunisia is the Ger
man high commands guinea pig.


Fight Is Dress Rehearsal.


Tunisia is a natural bastion.
Its natural obstacles have been
strengthened by man-made forti-
f1cations. The Allies have had
ample space for movement of
troops and amphibious operations
in landing forces in North Africa
and have been performing with
practically no opposition.


The Axis, on the other hand,
had to bring the necessary sup
plies and men from across the
Mediterranean.


The length of the resistance OF
the Axis forces fighting at dis
advantage will determine in the
Nazi general staf1's eyes their
chances of opposing a major as
sault by the Allies against the
much larger and far better forti-
flied European fortress.


To Berlin the battles in Tu-
nisia are nothing but a dress
rehearsal for the major battle
for Europe in which the Allies
will have to inch their way,
step by step, against Axis forces
boasting excellent lines of COM
munications and large stores of
ammunition and war material.


Sea Lanes Lose Importance.


Much has been said about the
Nazis not wanting to lose control
over Mediterranean sea lanes.
This control was important so
long as the Nazis expected to
take Egypt and the Suez Canal
by land from North Africa, but
from the moment the undertake
ing failed, the Mediterranean sea
lanes have become of slight i'm
portance.


The Germans still possess
island air and submarine bases
to interfere with Allied lines of
communicat ton from the Red
Sea.


The principal reason for ex-
tending the resistance in Tunisia
has been accomplished-that is,
time for completing the protect
Ing belt in Southern Europe.


Rommels continued hard fight
is believed due principally to the
fact that the Nazi high command
wants to learn by experiment
what chance it has of holding
the Allies after Tunisia falls."

 During his visit last winter, Lothian admitted quite frankly that ""appeasement"" had been a mistake. His attitude toward Hit Ter was completely reversed, and he felt that Chamberlain had been sadly outsmarted in his negotia- tions at Munich.

with it. Surveying their means
Of warfare, they either plan a
campaign or drop the project.
Meanwhile, we give publicity to a
tentative idea and then have to
concentrate our propaganda to
ourselves and the world on ex-
planning our failures.


Thus, this week the fact that
We lost ST per cent of the forces
engaged on the Dippe raid is
published in order to justify our
failure to open a second front,
and our propaganda is directed
not against our enemies, but
against our allies, the Russians.


In the same manner we are
forced to underline our shipping
losses in order to explain to our
allies and our own people why
we are impotent.


The effect on morale is devas-
tating. We do not believe that
the Anglo-American world is
weak. And If it is weak, then
this war is being. badly conducted
and badly organized. That is
the reaction OF the ordinary
man.


We now know that the Ger
mans and japanese are no super
men, that their industries are
not superior, and that the align
ment Of forces, If properly organ
lied and used, Is on our side, not
theirs.


And we don't need experts to
tell us why we are weak, but to
organize our strength. Above all,
we are tired of being told one
thing one day and another thing
the next, as though the people Of
the allied nations were the chief
target Of the war of nerves.""


To by no means detached OBJ
server of this war, it looks as
though we had better start it
and start 1t over again.


Start it by setting definite OBJ
jectives to be accomplished in a
definite area Of time; start it by
establishing a united command to
accomplish these objectives; start
1t by stopping a system whereby
every little detail has to be con-
sidered by two or three commit
tees: start it by having a political
as we'll as a military policy-and
sticking to that political policy
instead of explaining why we
have none.


The Germans and the Japanese
will not defeat the Anglo-Ameri-
can world, but it is by no means
certain that the Anglo-American
world will not go the way of
other powerful democracies and
defeat itself.

Rs the Associated Press.


POTSDAM, July 31.-Premier
Stain has been slightly indis-
posed for the last two days, it
was disclosed today, but is ex-
pected to attend a meeting of
the Big Three this afternoon.


An American public relations off,
Ger told correspondents at 5:45 pm.
today 10:45 am. Eastern war time)
that: Il presume meeting of the
Big Three is on now, but 1 can't con.
firm 1t yet""


The disclosure of Premier Stalin's
indisposition apparently explained a
two-day lapse in his talks with
President Truman and Prime Min
lister Attlee.


Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyache-
slav Molotov sat in with Mr.. Tru-
man and Mr.. Attlee on Sunday, but
there was no attempt to continue
the talks yesterday pending Premier
Stains complete recovery.


Physician Takes Precautions.


Premier Stains indisposition was
believed nothing more than a slight
cold, but the 66-year-old Premier's
physician took every precaution to
safeguard his health and ordered
him not to leave the house. 1t was
understood that numerous Soviet
colleagues saw Premier Stain.


His condition was reported i'm.
proved today and it was stated spe-
cif1cally that a meeting of the Big
Three was scheduled for the aft
ernoon.


II the Russian leader is fit enough
to resume the arduous three-hour
discussions which have been typical
of the conference to date, it is be-
lieved the conference may be COM
pleted by Thursday or Friday.


The talks are understood to have
reached point where the heaviest
work devolves on the Big Three
themselves.


Secrecy Maintained.


Through amblguously worded
daily reports that the conference
was continuing, the American and
pYIfich dalouotin withhold
Allied correspondents until late yes
terday the knowledge that the con-
ference had been interrupted.


Censorship prohibited attempts
by correspondents last night to re-
port the probable cause of the sus-
pension of Big Three discussions,
but this rule was relaxed today.


Official reports maintain a blan-
ket of secrecy around the unex-
pected delay. This was believed to
be the result of a British and
American wish to prevent any news
leak which is not approved before
hand by the Soviet delegation and
which might embarrass any of the
three delegations.


It appeared, however, that fur
ther interruptions were unlikely.


Foreign Secretaries Confer.


The German Communist party
newspaper Deutsche Volkszeitung,
published in Berlin. reprinted ex-
certps from an editorial in Moscow's
Pravda which declared that the
problems of the future for defeated
Germany are the central point"" of
the Potsdam Conference. The edi-
torial also attacked the Catholic
bishops of American-ruled Bavaria,
saying they were Lying about Ger
many's responsibility for thss war
and its consequences""


Meetings of the American, British
and Russian foreign secretaries have
been continuing as usual since the
last meeting between the tEree top
conferees Saturday night, it was
understood.


There had been some speculation
that the conference was to have
ended last night, but there was no
indication or belief that yesterdays
failure on the part of the Big Three
to meet had in any way delayed the
conferences conclusion.


In London, the British Press AS
sociation reported that plans were
under consideration"" for President
Truman to meet with King George
vi after the Potsdam Conference,
possibly at Plymouth.


The Brussels newspaper LIE Soir
said today the United States cruiser
Augusta, which brought President
Truman to Europe, left Antwerp

 Stalin's accusations before the All- Union Congress, included Great Britain, France. and the United States.

With Peuce-Bid Plan

MiIitory Writer Says Successes
In Eost Are Needed by Nozis
To Bolster Political Offensive",,"Stalingrad with a determination which
clearly indicates the tremendous import
ance which they attach to success In this
operation. The history of the last two
weeks has largely centered around this
German effort, which has been char
acterized by a series of checks due to
Russian resistance and local counter
attacks followed in each case by re-
neWal of the German effort brought
about by the introduction of fresh troops
into the battle. The number of German
divisions which have been withdrawn for
rest and reorganization must be con-
siderable, as likewise must be the number
of fresh divisions which have been put
in to carry on the fighting.


Stalingrad is an important military and
industrial objective, but all these German
sacrifices are not being made to gain
this prize because of its material value
either from the military or the economic
point of view. The Germans certainly
have material objectives in mind in their
operations in Russia this year; but the
Germans wage total war-which means
that political and psychological objec-
tives are always included in their plans.


From the material point of view, their
purpose in Russia this year is so to
reduce the Russian fighting power as to
make it impossible for the Russians to
stage full-scale counter offensive dur
ing the winter, or in the spring of 1943
This the Germans hope to accomplish by
a combination of effects-the destruction
of good part of the Russian armies, the
cutting off of the main Russian armies
from their Caucasian oil supply, or at least
reduction of the volume Of that supply,
and the pushing back of the Russians to
positions from which a counter offensive
really dangerous to the Germans cannot
be launched with any prospect of sue
cess. To all this may be added the effect
to be produced by depriving the Russians
of areas such as the Donets Basin which
are sources of foodstuffs, raw materials
and manpoWer as we'll as of industrial
production, and the restrictions put upon
their communication system by the loss
Of some of its main arteries.


If the Germans can free themselves





attack by the Russians within the i'm
mediate future, they will be able to turn
their major military attention to the
west, and perhaps also provide sufficient
forces for attempting further enter
prises in the Middle East; and they will
be able likewise to proceed with the
consolidation Of their position in the
interior of Europe


However, even the Germans can
hardly suppose that they will be in a
position to take the offensive on a
major scale against the British Isles
until they have made certain that they
will not in the meanwhile be called
upon for major effort elsewhere and
until they have had an opportunity to
organize the resources of conquered
Europe to support their operations.
Their need at the moment is for a
breathing spell; breathing spell on the
basis of their retention of the whole or
major part of their present conuuests.
To employ such breathing spell effec-
lively, it must be brought about in
such manner as to procure the sub
mission of most of the conquered
peoples to Nazi domination and ex-
ploitation. The fundamental Nazi idea
is to present the world with the picture
of Europe united under Nazi rule a
Europe self-contained economically and
militarily impregnable. In the accom-
plishment of such a purpose the cap
ture OF Stalingrad would serve symbolic
and psychological end as we'll as a
| strictly military one, which the almost
frantic and astonishingly persistent ex-
| ploitation by the Germans of their
| version of the Allied raid on Dieppe
| very clearly shows their anxiety to i'm
| press every one, their own people as
we'll as their enemies and their enslaved
neighbors, with the impregnability of
| their western flank


| That a great Nazi peace offensive will
come during the winter has long been a
| fo1egone conclusion. The object of this
| peace offensive will be to gain the breath
ing space necessary to the German plans
of world conquest: but to make such a
| peace offensive even family plausible
! there must be at least the appearance
| of great German successes in Russia
there must be situation on that front
| which the Germans can make to appear
sufficiently favorable to themselves that
their plea for peace-by which they really
mean merely temporary cessation of
hostilities-may find some response
among the more fainthearted of their
opponents.


The objectives of the United Nations
in Europe must therefore be to support
the Russians in every possible way, to
block the Nazi plans for unified Europe
by every military and political means
and to keep up such offensive operations
as are possible not only for the military
results to be obtained but for the psv-
Geological effect on our own peoples and
those whom we hope to free from Naz
rule. We must never forget that to win
this war material superiority alone will
not be enough; if we put all our faith In
material factors we shall be defeated We
must meet the enemy with faith. a fire
and fury superior to his own, with q
fanatical belief in the sacredness of our
cause which will exclude from our minds
the very thought of possible defeat: all


welded into an unshakable will to victory


Our enemies know full well that they


have more to fear from our progress
toward spiritual unity of purpose than


they would from the doubling of the


output of our factories and trainine


centers."

Russia severed relations with Po-

anime German charges that the
Russians had killed 10000 Polish
officers in the Katyn Forest near
Smolensk. Since then the Lublin

Russia has gained ascendancy with
the Kremlin and the breach has
widened.


Frank Understanding Seen.


A frank understanding between
Russia and Britain in dealing with
the Balkans and Poland appeared to
be emerging from the Churchill
Stain conferences.


Indications Of unity of purpose In
dealing with the Balkan situation
developed last night when Moscow
announced that Bulgaria had ac-
cepted preliminary armistice condi-
tions agreed on by the Allies and
had promised to evacuate within
two weeks territory seized from
Greece and Yugoslavia.


Marshal Tito, commander of
Yugoslavia's lighting forces, has left
his country for Moscow to partici-
pate In the Churchill-St talks,
the Marseille radio reported today.


The announcement concerning
Bulgaria's acceptance of preliminary
armistice conditions said withdrawal
OF Bulgarian troops from Greek and
Yusoslav soil would be supervised
by Z tri-partite military commission
under the Craftsmanship Of Rus
sian representative.


Must Start at Once.


The evacuation must start imme-
diately and final armistice condi-
tions for Bulgaria will not be settled
until it Is completed, the announce
ment added.


The Allied governments, through
the European Advisory Commission,
have been considering these armis-
tice conditions since September 9,
when the Russians ended hostilities
against the Bulgarians after a one
day war.


The withdrawal demand does not
apply to Bulgarian troops fighting
In Yugoslavia in cooperation with
the Russians and Marshal Tito.


Speaking at the dinner given in his
honor by Prime Minister Churchill,
Premier Stain said both Russia and
Britain had played big parts in the
war, but the stupendous production
and organizing ability of the United
States had helped turn the tide.

Premier Stain spoke long and

until almost midnight.

 Though the Harry Hopkins-Josef Stalin talks at the Kremlin are still a closely guarded secret, one significant detail has now been transmitted back to the Diplomatic Corps.

 Hopkins naturally raised the question of the 16 Poles who had surrendered to the Russians with the idea that they were to discuss the formation of new Polish government, but who since then have been imprisoned. Stalin ad- mitted that not all Is were im- plicated in any charge of work ing against the Red Army. He also admitted that the only charge was of working against the Red Army. He also admitted that the only charge against them was that they had used secret radio to contact London.

 However, Stalin pointed to the possibility of the Poles passing valuable information on to the Germans who were at that time monitoring all broadcasts. He said that only those believed guilty would be tried, and that the others would be liberated soon. Stalin did not specify the number to date."

 Conferences Here",,"Washington, Nov. 23.-(UP)--Bar- ring any unforeseen developments. President Truman will insist that the next Big Three meeting be held in Washington. Informed sources said today.

 The fact is that the President sees little prospect of a meeting any time soon with Prime Minister Clement Attlee and Generalissimo Josef Stalin. He has said as much publicly and privately in the face of recurrent London and Moscow reports that another meeting was planned.

 MT. Truman's current position, however, is that when Attlee and Stalin want to meet with him, he will be glad to see them in Wash ington, but not in Moscow, London or some other distant part of the world.

 According to some of the Presi- dents close associates, he feels now that most of the matters which during the war would have been handled by the Big Three can now be discussed by their Council of Foreign Ministers.

 A change in the personnel of the Big Three is one development that might produce quick meeting of top Anglo-Soviet-American leaders.

 There have been persistent re- ports that .Stalin is or has been in poor physical health. The fuel which has kept their reports alive has been Stalin's continued absence from traditional Soviet functions which he had not missed since becoming the dominant figure of the Russian government."

 Murphy goes voluntarily before 8 judiciary subcommittee, which al- ready has approved his nomination, to answer criticism of his handling of labor disputes while he was gov- ernor of Michigan.

 Senator Hiram w. Johnson, R.. California, demanded that Hopkins testify further on detailed charges of WPA political activity contained in the report of the senate cam paign committee."

 Many and more frequent are the com ments of the press and private molvlo- ualS concerning what official washing ton will do when Gus"" Lonergan retlres next month. To our way ot thinking there is only one thing that should be done, There are available positions of honor and trust to which Senator Loner- gan could and should be appointed. In such a statement we know that we find ready support from both Democrats and Republicans who, now that the election is over and the votes counted, find 1t difficult to express themselves without some show of sorrow at the fate of Sen- ator Lonergan.

 The immediate reaction in the state when it was announced that Attorney General Homer S. Cummings would retire from the Presidents Cabinet after the first of the year was that here was the opening for Senator Lonergan. We don't think, though, that this should be taken seriously and we know that Senator Lon- ergan himself doesn't, nor has he any aspirations or hopes in this direction But there are other means available, such as a federal judgeship. There need be no creation of jobs to continue efficient public service, such as Gus"" Lonergan can give. He is capable of filling any high office to which he may be called. We trust that President Roosevelt will heed the wishes of Connecticut in this in- stance."

declaration that the American
representative on the proposed
world security council must have

for the organization.


Observers believe this is true be-
cause one of the big doubts in the
minds of other nations, remember
ing the attitude of the Senate in
l918-19, is whether the United
States will commit itself to the use
of force without congressional con-
sent in each instance.


While it is realized that the Pres
ident can not commit this country
legally to such course, and that he
must have the Senate's ratification,
the fact that he has publicly put
himself on record is expected to in
f1uence foreign governments. In
view of the Senate's passage of the
Connally resolution, many observ-
ers believe that body, as now consti-
tuted, would be willing to give the
American delegate on the council
the broad powers suggested by the
President.

Dumbarton Oaks discussion, it was
pointed out.


In view of this, there is no doubt
that the State Department would be
able to prepare speedily the neces-
sary legislation to provide American
adherence to the United Nations Sc
curity organization and the corol-
larry protocols providing for the use
of American forces, with those of
other powers, to stem aggression.


The next step in security planning
is for this country, Great Britain,
Russia and China to find agree
ment on several points which were
left in doubt at Dumbarton Oaks


The most delicate of these is vot-
ing procedure in the council, spe-
cifically whether nation may vote
on a dispute involving itself, as
Russia insists that it should.


Other issues still left open are
how the present League of Nations
shall be iquidated and what dis

About 70 nurses are required to

taken by congress to change this phase
of the law safeguarding arrival OF unit
foreigners, nor has any war emergency
submerged the quota rule. Lacking any
official explanation, it looks Just like
another high-handed act of the executive

But it will be remembered that through
some hook or crook, but not by congress
sional action, the administration found a
way to permit the red Earl Browder's
wife to remain in this country after her
stay limit had expired,


And it doesn't mean a thing that the
announcement mentioned that the retug-
ees are to be sent back home after the
war or at some date to be set by the exec

safe bet they will be forgotten and grad

as these poor war victims may have sui
fered and been made homeless because
of fascist rule there still is the immigra
ton barrier. Furthermore, 1t would be
measurably easier and more to the COM
fort of the refugees to house them in
their home areas and if necessary help
them.


No one hardly could deny our bounty
and generosity in these instances, but
someone has to be logical and use sense,
otherwise we may as we'll ditch our I'M
migration restraints and invite the hun

of the war-torn European nations to come

there is nothing to hinder him from multi
plying the order, expensive transporta

This latest overriding of congressional
duties should spur congress to tighten
the immigration laws. Always there has
been an element in congress. enthusiased
by political fervOr, to break down our
immigration limitations and it IS up to
the other groups which have kept the
bars up to be on guard now.


There is wide criticism, too, on bring

Many see no necessity for the cost of
transporting them across oceans when
there is plenty of room to confine them
where they are captured.


This nation has to keep on plugging

find our constitutional fences torn down

for women in 1840""


The roll was prepared. by Mrs

for the future.

tant careers open to women in 1910


Earlier. Mrs. Roosevelt presided al
panel discussion of realities which
women must face about themselves
and about the world as it is now and
as 1t might be-""


Community Service Urged.


At one point Mrs. Roosevelt said
""A great many women today demand
an opportunity for service. 1t is the
first time in a long while that we
have considered our obligations a,
well as our rights.


""The time is coming when the
question Of specified training fol
women and girls will have to be
faced. imagine we are going to
have to meet this question very
soon. Some think the Government
has no right to draft men and this
feeling Is intensified when 1t comes
to women and girls. I find that
many Of those in Government shy
away from that as from the plague

Some of the other views expressed
by the panel were:

lished by the Pan-American Con-
gress-'Women should stop study
ing situations, and go in and act.
We shouldn't think 100 years ahead

Women Called Citizens First.


Marion E. Martin, women's di-
vision chairman of the Repub-

should realize they are citizens first,
and women second""


Mrs. Thomas McAllister, women's
division chairman of the Demo-

American women were struggling
really with themselves. I don't see
great deal of opposition to wom-

we ought to do""


Mrs. Raymond Sayre, representing
rural women, said that farm women
today were producing 50 per cent
in excess of enough children to pro-
duce stationary population; but
that city women were producing
less than enough to provide a sta

tion involves not merely the choice
OF a president but an accounting
OF the four years stewardship OF
the office and an appraisal OF the

Veteran California Law maker Passes Away

 af Age of 79

(contimued from Page one)",,"Johnson, who served as Governor of California from 1910 until his election to Congress six years later described himself as Progressive Republican""

 Hiram Warren Johnson cut his own. political path across partisan lines for more than generation beginning with the Governorship ot California and followed by his cleo tion. to the United States Senate five successive times.

 Called President hater"" by some, he did not see eye to eye with any President from Taft on, even though he supported each of them at times.

 Californians responded with over whelming approval. He became such a powerful political figure that he repeatedly won nomination by democratic, republican and progress sive parties, regardless of which was dominant in his state or the nation.

 Twice Deserted COP

 Although he became dean of re- publican senators in point of ser vice, he openly deserted his party On two cccasions-the first time to stand at Armageddon"" as vice. presidential nominee with Theodore Roosevelt and the Bull Moosers in 1912; the cecond time in 1892 when he campaigned for MT. Roosevelt.

 Throughout his career he prese- vcred in a nationalistic outlook, op- posing with fiery zeal every measure which he regarded as likely to draw America into European politics.

 To him, Europe was a good place to keep away from. He stood in the front rank of that famous group of senate ""irreconcilables' who band cd to defeat President Wilson's League of Nations covenant.

 Again, he teamed with Senator William E. Borah in 1885 to oppose proposed American adherence to the world court and administer to MT. Roosevelt his first major congress ional defeat in the field of foreign affairs.

 If there was consuming ambition in Hiram Johnson's life it was said to be the Presidency. Strangely enough he kept both himself and another-so it was asserted-out of that high office.

 Offered the presidential nom- ination on the republican ticket with Warren G. Harding in 1920, he re- fused. Calvin Coolidge accepted and became president when Harding died in office.

 The Hughes slight""

 Four years earlier, the famous slight"" of Johnson by Charles Ev- ans Hughes, when the latter was campaigning in California as the republican presidential nominee, was accounted by many as having cost Hughes the election. Califor- mia went for Wilson by 3,806 votes, while Johnson was elected senator by the greatest majority in the his tory of the state, up to that time.

 Johnson's political creed was em- bodied in his statement of why he broke with Herbert Hoover in 1882.

 For many. years, in the politics of this nation,' he said, two dis tinct political philosophies have constantly clashed, and in the pres ent economic crisis these two con- flicting philosophies stand out the che against the other in bold relief. On the one hand is the progressive, On the other the ultra a-conservative.

 T am progressive republican; MT. Hoover is not. He has justly earned the title of ultra -conserva- tive. The difference between the two may be described in general ization, and could be particularized in a hundred acts of the existing national administration

 ""The progressive. thinks in terms of human beings; the standpatter has little thought or concern for them""

 Among his accomplishments in congress, was authorship of the Swing Johnson act which made pos bible the gigantic Boulder dam. More than that, however, his admirers be- lieved he would wish to be remem- hered for the reforms in government which marked his tenure of the gov ernorship of California.

 California Accomplishments

 Written into the states constitu- ton at his behest were provisions for the initiative, referendum and recall; the direct primary, woman suffrage and the wiping out of na- tional party lines in municipal and county elections. Under him, too, California took the lead in legislat- ing for working mems compensation, limiting hours of work for women, creating a state marketing depart ment, protecting investors in lands, mines and oil, regulating railroads and public utilities and in prison re- form.

 Born at Sacramento, Calif., on September 2, 1866, he entered politics in 1910, winning the Goyernorship in that year. He was reelected in 1914 and had served two years of his occond term when he won senate seat in 1916 He was returned in moo 1000 1n2d and 1ndn"

Hit by Wheeler
And Borah

Senators to Oppose
Any Special Levyos
Hitting Little Fellow",BY the Associated Press.,"BY the Associated Press.


Senators Borah, Republican, of
Idaho and Wheeler, Democrat, of
Montana served notice today they
would oppose special taxes to pay
for increased national defense costs.


Both Senators said they felt that
if any such taxes were proposed.
they would be bound to fall on the
""little fellow who could least af-
ford to pay them.


The problem of meeting the rising
costs of national defense has been
receiving President Roosevelt's prin-
cipal attention in recent days. He
said at Warm Springs, Ga, yester-
day that normal and emergency de-
tense expenditures would be sep
arated in the budget for next year.


Into an ""A"" budget, he explained,
would go ordinary expenses of the
Army and Navy and into a ""B""
budget would go approximately
$500 900 900 of proposed expenditures
which he said may be attributed to
the European war.


Borrowing Seen Alternative.


Mr.. Roosevelt said previously that
these increased expenditures posed
the question whether special taxes
should be voted by Congress to meet
them. The alternative, he said.
would be to borrow the money and
increase the Governments deficit.


Senator Borah said he could not
commit himself to any special tax
until he knew who would be ex-
pected to pay it.


TT all ends up. it seems to me. in
the nature of a sales tax-in other
words. a tax that puts the burden
on those who are not only least
able to pay. but who are wholly
unable to pay"" he declared. Il
would not favor that


You can destroy the citizenship
of a country, its morale and its
worth almost as effectively through
taxation as you can through war


Senator Wheeler expressed the
belief that almost any kind of tax
that could be devised would fall
eventually on the little fellow""
adding: THE country wouldn't stand
for that""


Doughton Against Sales Tax.


Chairman Doughton of the House
Ways and Means Committee said
that since the administration had
made no tax recommendations, he
would not hazard guess as to
what the attitude of his committee
would be toward levying a tax for
defense funds in campaign year.


""Of course"" he continued, ""the
tax would not be collected until
after the election. but my idea is
that the best politics is to do right.
If additional revenue is necessary to
build up the country's defenses, pol
itics should have no consideration
in the matter""


Representative Doughton expressed
strong opposition to a general sales
tax


Meanwhile a House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee continued hear
ings on Mr.. Roosevelt's request for
an additional S271 ,999 900 for the
armed services as a result of his
order increasing the personnel of
both the Army and Navy and estab-
fishing the neutrality patrol.

crat. of Virginia. acting chairman,
said it was hoped to complete the
hearings tomorrow or Friday."

With Roosevelt


Bob Hill, Transferred


From Slab, Expected


To Star at First",By GEORGE HUBER.,"A fellow who was a flop as left
handed pitcher last year may make
the difference between a losing and
winning baseball team at Central
High this year, where the Vikings
are set to begin defense of their
sChoolboy title against Roosevelt to-
morrow.


Bob Hill, 16-year-old junior, has
been moved by Coach Jack Ray from
the slab to first base. He'll be the
best first baseman in the series, Ray
promises, taking into consideration
such lads as Howard Keithley at
Tech, Don Hillock at Wilson, and
Bob Leach, Western captain, all of
whom do more than a fair Job of
ball playing.


The shift makes Central so per
cent better than it was when prac-
tice began several weeks ago, because
in the words of Coach Ray, Il have
three ball players noW-Hill. Di
BlaSi and Lagos"" Sam Di Blasi at
third and zellos Lagos. catcher,
were the only real veterans of any
ability on the Central team until Hill
was shifted from the mound.


Hits Fence at 400 Feet.


AS pitcher last year he had no
control and almost gave up, but he
could hit, so Ray tried him at first
with happy results.


His hitting ability was demon
strated in the game with George
Washington High on Tuesday. He
smacked triple that Travelled 400
feet and bounced off a fence. In
almost any place else except the
spacious G. w. stadium it would
have been a homer.


Even with Hill adding uneXpect-
ed punch and defensive ability to
the team, Central still has many
problems facing it in the title race.
Main one is lack of practice. The
schools own diamond is undergo
ing a face-lifting, and the Vik-
ings have been able to get work
outdoors at only odd intervals. Ex-
actly five sessions have been held
outside the gym. These have been
on the Ellipse diamonds. Ray has
been having a hard time obtain
ing permits because the public fields
are supposed to be used only for
actual games.


Concentrate on Batting.


The few practice sessions the
Vikings have held have been de-
voted to batting. because Ray rea-
sons that team that can hit can
beat a defensive outfit four times
out Of five.


In addition to Hill, Lagos and Di
Blasi (there they are again) are
the only ones demonstrating real
power at the plate so far. Lack of
practice is the reason others are
tagging.


The pitching load will be car
ried by Arron WeiSenberg and Har-
ry Wolfe, both newcomers to the
team. Charles Kligman, who was
expected to be the No. l hurler
because of his experience last year,
Is dropping to the No. 3 slot.


Also making its debut in the
1941 interhigh series tomorrow is
Westerns experienced team, which

the most trouble


The Red Raiders are meeting

quences are raising Nightmares with
which to frighten little children.
And, anyhow, they are nothing but
lot OF reactionary old Roosevelt
haters"" who want to grind down
the poor and would stop at nothing
to get that man"" out OF the White
House.


For more than 10 years the New
Dealers have maintained themselves
against attack by this kind of bal
derdash. 1t seems incredible that
such stuff could be accepted as ar
gument and used to conceal the
facts. But their success with it in
the past is beyond dispute, and they
are still using it.


In their campaign this time, there
are elements and prospects which
few unfeverish persons, it would
seem, could consider without some
degree of apprehension. Yet, men,
ton of these is met in the same way
administration criticism always has
been met--to wit, by a complete ig-
noring Of the facts, by cheap ridi-
cule, demagogic appeal to the un-
thinking masses and personal abuse.


Dread Consequence Seen.


Nevertheless, it is the purpose here
again to draw attention to one Of
the surest and most-to-b dreaded
consequences Of Roosevelt re-elec-
ton. This Is the almost certain ex-
lstence for the next four years Of
Congress hostile to and distrust-
full Of the Executive, one which he
could neither coerce, control or per-
suade to follow him.


It is unreasonable to contend that
II Mr.. Roosevelt wins he is bound
to carry in with him majority Of
the House, because that has been
what has happened in nearly every
election in the past. Those who
thus argue do so because they do not
want to face the facts.


The fact Is that, despite prece-
dents, there is hardly practical
politician or an informed observer
on either side who believes that in
the event of Mr.. Roosevelt's re-
election. the House would have even
a nominal Democratic majority,
much less an actual administration
one.


There is almost complete unan-
Unity of opinion among them that
the Republicans will be in entire
control of that body. For this con-
viction, there are sound grounds.


The numerous congressional BY
elections of the past two years have
increased the Republican House
membership to the point where they
almost have majority in the pres
ent Congress. These have shown
Republican trend in the district
which is generally conceded.


Mr.. Roosevelt's candidacy, clearly,
is a personal one, depending upon
the war for success, and there is not
the slightest reason for thinking
That. so far as candidates for House
and Senate are concerned, this trend
will be reversed in November.


On the contrary. the political be-
lief is that 1t will be accentuated,
1t being plain that in nearly every
State there are many voters who.
voting for Mr.. Roosevelt for reasons
connected with the war, will stop
there.


Loss Of Congress Control.


It, of course, is true that the
Senate, because of its present make
up and the fact that only one third
Of its membership is to be elected,
will remain nominally Democratic.
though the Republicans are sure to
gain some seats. AS the Senate is
already antiadministration, through
Its majority Of Republicans and
anti-New Deal Democrats, this
means that 1t would be more so
after a fourth-term election.


In brief, the odds are overwhelm-
Ing that as fourth-term President.
Mr.. Roosevelt, who has been unable
to control this Congress in which the
Democrats have nominal majorities
IN both branches, would find himself
confronted with Congress over
neither branch OF which he would
have even semblance of control.


Thus would"" be created the worst
possible situation for dealing with
the vast and vital postwar problems.
all OF which are being pushed over
until after the election.


In the White House, there would
be a tired, aging President, unable
to lead or direct the legislative
branch, secure acceptance of his
views or adoption of his recommen-
dations. And. at the Capitol, there
would be a Congress without leader
ship.


AS has frequently been pointed
out, this Is the worst situation that
can arise under our form of Gov
ernment. 1t means both executive
and legislative futility. 1t means a
practical paralysis of Government
and a dangerous chaos.


The probabilities that Roosevelt
reelection would create a condition
such as this are so strong that it is
difficult to see how any informed

With an anxious eye on the
White House. the House Ways
and Means Committee started
work today on a new tax bill
which many House members said
likely would contain some form
of general sales tax.


President Roosevelt plans TO send
a message to Congress next week
discussing means Of retarding the
rise in living costs and. informed
sources said, the necessity OF con-
trolling unusual excess profits in

Program Still Indefinite.


Members said that until the mes

know definitely whether they would
be expected to use as base for the
bill the $3.50 1000, 900 tax recon-
mendations of Secretary Morgen-

As advance speculation on the
nature OF the program spread over
wide range Of possibilities, White
House Secretary Stephen Early told
a press conference today that he
did not believe any portion of the
program has yet reached a point
Of final determination.


In order that he may have suffi-

to the Congress and his anticipated
radio address to the Nation, PreSi-

Corporation Tax Is Up First.


Despite lack of concrete recon-
mandations, Ways and Means Com

of starting work today, taking up

Mr.. Morgenthau also recommend

pay 100000, 900 more in taxes, a
burden that would fall most heavily
on the middle-income brackets, and
that excise levies be increased by

Sales Tax Seen Necessary.


When we get through, we will
probably find that we will have only
a $4,000 000, 600 or perhaps $6,000.-
100000 bill; then it will be a oues-
ton of whether we will have to go
to sales tax to make up the differ

A survey showed that most of
the members favored a sales tax,
but there was little agreement on
its form. Some preferred a manu-
facturers' levy, to avoid the rela-

retail tax. Others favored the lat

the article reached the consumer.

Sumner Welles, as Under Secretary, never hesitated to stand up for what he thought was the right policy. If he saw the President getting off on tangent he battled it out. He had known FDR since he served as page at the Roosevelt wedding and he wasn't afraid to say what he thought.

 Unfortunately, Ed Stettinius and the new State Department aids have no experience in standing up to the President and probably are afraid to. They were hired on the basis that if they didn't behave they'd be fired and they owe every thing to him.

 It is generally known for in- stance, that Stettinius did not ap- prove the three-vote deal at Yalta, and that he also favored open publicity on this and other things. Tn the end, when the clean light of publicity was focused on the three-vote deal, the American posi- tion was corrected.

Autographed brochures were in
circulation urging the availability
of Gov Joseph M. Broughton of
North Carolina. A breakfast was
planned for him on the convention S
opening day and former Gov. o.
Max Gardner of North Carolina was
designated as his campaign man

was reported under way to bring the

While the recommended platform
might conceivably duck the racial
question, the convention itself faced
the necessity of dealing with its re-

would carry Texas and other South

Senator Pepper, carrying around

his own making, said: I'VE want a
short platform and one that says
what we mean. We will not write

OF course it could not. But that Is
just the trouble with trying to do things
in that fashion; it was the same in the

was tried and found wanting and when
at last a supreme war council was
created under the pressure of imminent

Roosevelt has taken a step that is
clearly in the public interest. In
June Congress conferred upon the

under the powers vested in him by

CHICAGO. Feb. ""a copyrighted
dispatch to the Chicago Tribune
yesterday said President Roosevelt
had received a draft Of an order
together with proposal to estab-
lish central intelligence service""
charged with coordination Of post
war intelligence work and supersed-l
Ing existing Federal police agencies. |


The papers Washington bureau,
IN an article by Walter Trojan, said
the highly confidential and secret""
memorandum was given Mr.. Roose-
velt by Brig. Gen. william ]. Dom
ovan, director of the Office of
Strategic Services. The ofiice
would have no police power.


The Tribune asserted it had ""se-
cured exclusively"" a copy of the
memorandum and added:


""The Tribune also obtained a copy
OF an equally secret suggested draft
OF an order setting up the general
Intelligence service, which would SUI
persede all existing Federal police
and intelligence units, including mil
itary intelligence, naval intelligence,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Secret Service, the Internal
Revenue agents and the Federal
Communications Commission which
monitors all radio airways. The
order gives the unit a wholesale
grant of power""


Copies Sent to Officials.


Only Is copies of the two docu-
ments were made, the paper de-
clared, each plaStered with secrecy
injunctions."" According to the story
these were sent to officials such as
Admiral William E. Leahy, the
Presidents chief Of staff, Gen.
George C. Marshall, army chief of
staff, Admiral Ernest ]. King, COM
mander in chief of the fleet; Secre-
retary of State Stettinius, Secretary
OF Navy Forrestal, and Secretary of
War Stimson.


The Tribune quoted the Donovan
memorandum as saying:
Once our enemies are defeated
the demand will be equally pressing
for information that will aid us in
solving the problems of the peace.


This will require two things:


II. That intelligence control be
returned to the supervision of the
President.


g. The establishment of a central
authority reporting directly to you
(the President), with responsibility
to frame intelligence objectives and
to collect and coordinate the intel
Igence material required by the ex-
ecutive branch in planning and
carrying out the national policy and
strategy""


permanent Long Range Plan""


This would be ""a permanent long
range plan,"" the Tribune quoted the
memorandum, ""but you may want to
consider whether this Cor part of
it) should be done now, by execu-
tive or legislative action.


THE immediate revision and CO.
ordination of our present intel
hgence system would effect sub
stantial economies and aid the
more efficient and speedy termina-
tion of the war.


Information important to the
national defense, being gathered
now by certain departments and
agencies, is not being used to full
advantage in the war. Co-ordina-
ton at the strategy level would
prevent waste and avoid the present
confusion that leads to waste and
unnecessary duplication""


The paper said the suggested
order draft called for creation
within the executive Offices of the
new service, to be headed by a presi-
Dental appointee, and working with
an advisory board composed of the
Secretaries of War and Navy to-
getner with others the President
may deem necessary.


Seven Principal Functions.


The agency, with an independent
budget"" would have seven principal
functions, according to the article.
These would be: Coordination of
""all intelligence agencies of the
Government"" to assure ""integration
OF national intelligence efforts""
collection of pertinent informa-
ton"" on foreign nations; evaluation
and dissemination of this informa-
ton; procurement and training of
personnel; ""subversive operations
abroad; determination of policies
essential to the collection of infor-
nation; such other activities as
the President may require;


And finally, the agency shall have
no police or law enforcement func-
tions, either at home or abroad""


Under this order, the Tribune said.
it would be possible for the director
ito determine American foreign
policy by wedding out, withholding.

by President Roosevelt as he signed
the Hatch bill to prevent pernicious
political activities"" that measure
holds bright promise of a cleaner era
in American politics. The bill, in
brief, is designed to prevent Federal
jobholders from using the weight of
their positions to influence national
elections by coercing votes and COM
pelling political contributions. II the
law is reasonably successful in ac-
complishing that end, and there is
every reason to suppose that it will
SO succeed, the country will be in
debted to two New Mexico legisla-
tors-Senator Hatch, who wrote the
bill and pushed it through the SEN
ate, and Representative Dempsey,
who pried the measure loose from a
skeptical Judiciary Committee and
shepherded it to enactment in the
House.


The President, although expressing
himself as in sympathy with the OBJ
jectiveS of the bill, signed it without
enthusiasm, releasing at the same
time an extraordinary message to
Congress in which he undertook to
answer number of questions he said
had arisen under the measure. With
out going into the propriety of an
attempt by a President to interpret
officially the meaning Of a statute
function normally exercised by the
courts-it should be pointed out that
in this case the objections to the bill
implicit in the questions and answers
cited by Mr.. Roosevelt are too unsub-
tantial to merit serious consideration.
There was one objection raised by
the President, however, that is worthy
OF some comment.


After expressing his confidence
that the proponents of the legislation
Intended that the right of free speech
shall remain even"" to those who
serve their Government, and that the
Government itself shall have full
right to place all facts in its possess
sion before the public, Mr.. Roosevelt
added: eff some future administra-
ton should undertake to administer
this legislation to the detriment of
these rights, such action would be
contrary to the purpose of the act
itself and might well infringe the
constitutional rights of citizens""


That statement illustrates the
weakness of the Presidents argu-
ments against the legislation, for it
was the fragrant abuse of Federal
patronage in national elections dur
Ing his administration, and not the
fear of what some future admins
tratlon might do, that led directly to
the enactment of the bill."

Let us turn 20 the recent report 0f
the Dies Committee report which
won universal applause for its fair
ness and its obiectivity.


I'm the case Of the American
Youth Congress- reported the Dies
Committee, ""the committee finds a
central organization which has no
membership Of its own, but which
attempts to affiliate together the
largest possible number Of organiza-
tioHs Of American young people. the
vast majority Of whom have no con-
neetioh with Communism, Nazi-lsm

are members Of some Of the most
necessary and valuable organizations
which our country possesses.


Communist Influence Held Great


'The Young Communist League. as
well as certain other organizations
in which Communists have played an
important part is affiliated with the
American Youth Congress and testi-
mony has been presented to the
committee to indicate that this min-
ority group has at times exerted an
influence on the American Youth
Congress out Of all proportion to its
size.


THE COMMITTEE is UNABLE
TO SEE HOW IT is POSSIBLE FOR

INSTITUTIONS AND LIFE OF
AMERICA TO EXPECT TO PRO
NOTE THAT WORK BY INCLUD-
ING WITHIN ITS RANKS THOSE
WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN DEM
OCRACY, BUT IN A CONTRARY
PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE AND FORM
OF GOVERNMENT""


Nor can we see how this is pos
sible. What is more, we cannot un-
derstand why the Presidential family
feels it necessary to go out Of its
way to show friendship for an organ
ization subject to such criticism as
that directed against the American
Youth Congress by the unanimous
vote of the Dies Committee.


CoddIlng Of LASER Recalled


And yet, such things should not
surprise us after witnessing the
manner in which the President, HaT-
ry Hopkins and National Youth Adj
ministrator Aubrey williams have
ccddled David LASER and his Com
munistic-tinged Workers Alliance.
LASER not only has the blessing Of
the New Deal but he appears TO have
entry to the Presidents office when
ever he wants it. Indeed, the White
House has used him to embarFass for
political purposes State Governors
struggling with their local problems.


The records of the Dies Commit
tee contain testimony from Herbert
Benjamin, Secretary Treasurer Of
the Workers Alliance, to the effect
that the Communist Party inspired
and brought about thee formation Of
the Workers Alliance. BENJAMIN is
an avowed Communist and LASER
admitted going to Moscow as ""a dele

ses being paid by the dues wrung

 Democratic Divisional Committees at Juneau and Nome have gone on record opposing the appointment of a nonresident of the Territory. Di- mond said he felt sure the action had been communicated to the President and to Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes.

 Dr. Gruening's appointment was not submitted at the special session because of the Presidents desire to limit work to the Neutrality bill.

 Not Personal

 Delegate Dimond said there was nothing personal in his, opposition to Gruening's appointment but that  it is based entirely upon the desire of the people of Alaska for an AL askan Governor.

 ""Dr. Gruening is very well liked in Alaska and if we must have a nonresident for Governor I am sure he will fill the bill"" Dimond said.

 Dr. Gruening said he had talked the matter over with Secretary Ickes and been informed the President expected to give him a recess ap- pointment or send his name to Con- gress for confirmation at the regu- lar session next year

 Gruening told reporters he pre- ferred the recess appointment and If appointed would prefer to go to Alaska as soon as possible even if it entailed returning to Washing ton for confirmation""

 Dr. Gruening said he had no per- sonal knowledge of opposition to him in Alaska or elsewhere. It was said the opposition likely came from To- cal interests which had other ideas about the Governorship."

active days Of campaigning early

bulk of the backing of relief clients,
W.P.A. employees, tenant farmers,
sharecroppers and unskilled labor

Roosevelt's corner.

matter of gratitude than de-
sire to maintain their status quo

minor governmental officials and
employees and their families whose

Collaborating with some men,

under the direction of Undersecre-
tary Of State Welles has begun q
comprehensive survey of the prob
lens the world will face when the
war ends. it was learned yesterday.


One influential LEGISLATOR, who
asked NOT to be quoted by name,
said 1t was his understanding that
an attempt was being made to pre-
pare a thorough going analysis that
would put detailed information on
world conditions ut the f1ngertips Of
American ddiciais when they sit
down at the peace table.


Broad Field Covered


This study was said to range the
broad field of international relations,
including the economic, political
and social trends to be taken into
account when the peace-makers set
about their task of revamping a
world geared almost exclusively to
war for years.


Legislators who professed know
ledge of the project said it seemed
obvious to them the survey would
be based on the prospects Of a
peace embodying the four freedoms
President Roosevelt enunciated in
his January 6, 1941 message to
Congress-freedom of speech, free
domdom of religion. freedom from
want and freedom from fear.


The idea of maintaining a cur
rent study Of peace problems won
applause from members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit

views as Senators Lee, Democrat,
of Oklahoma, an early advocate of
American Intervention In the war,
and Nye, Republican, of North Da-
kota, who opposed President Roose-
velt's foreign policies vigorously be

While Senator Lee said he had
no personal knowledge of State De-
partment studies, he was thoroughly
in accord with any step that might
be taken to prepare this country to
face the problems Of peace intel
ligently.

that his candidacy might be
challenged by Mr.. Dewey, If he
were Governor.


With the wealthy group on the
one hand and the Willkie sup
porters on the other, both op-
posed to the Dewey candidacy
though for somewhat different
reasons-there is drive to con-
vince Mr.. Dewey that he should
step aside and permit the nomi-

Governor this year. Presumably
Mr.. Dewey could get the nomi-
nation If he went after it-no
matter what these groups under
take to do against him. Dewey
is still strong with the party Or
ganization in the state. Mr..
Dewey has still to announce him
self q candidate. If and when he
does. Mr.. Willkie will be asked to
say where he stands on this
candidacy.


1t has been suggested in some
quarters that Mr.. Willkie might
go the length Of supporting Gov.
Lehman. Democrat, against
Mr.. Dewey. There is no truth
whatever in that report or that
Mr.. Willkie will become a DEM
ocrat. He will support no DEM
ocratic candidates for office this
year. either for Governor or for
Congress. He will support those
Republicans whom he believes
are sound on foreign affairs, as
we'll as domestic, and where he
thinks they are not he will keep
silent. This will not, however,
prevent his support OF a Repub-
lican whose views he likes
against a Republican whose views
he does not like. either in a
primary election or In state con-
vention. With such a program
he could work to defeat Repre-
sentative Fish of New York, Re-
publican isolationist, and he will
do so If Mr.. Fish seeks renomi-
nation. 1t is understood. how
ever. that Mr.. Fish is soon to go
into the Army. If he does, he
will resign from the House.


On the Democratic side, eff
forts are being made to persuade
Gov. Lehman to run for a fifth
term. If he does not, then an at
tempt will be made to draft for
mer Postmaster General James
A. Farley, at present chairman
of the Democratic State Commit

declared they are not candidates.

RETARD RECOVERY",,"On TWO recent occasions President
Roosevelt has predicted that defeats he
suffered In congress will have the effect
OF retardlng recovery. Each time he said
the action of congress would cost tax
payers hundreds of millions of dollars.


The first time was when congress ig-
nored his wishes on neutrality egisla-
ton. The president said the vote would
put an immediate halt to a mice little
business BOOM"" Next day the stock mar
ket began climbing. 1t is still doing very
well.


This week the president was angered
again when his lending bill was turned
down by congress. The action will re-
tard recovery cost the taxpayers hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. and re-
fleet in relief he said He said a great
many people will be deprived of Jobs
which they might otherwise have had.
He said reduction in taxes which would
have been possible now is impossible.


The president argued that the lend
ing program would have sent new orders
flowing into industrial plants. These
plants, he said, would have begun to
hire more people, and relief rolls would
have declined. Greater economic wealth
would have reduced taxes he declared.
Results of the program would have been
felt in industry in 60 or 80 days, he add
ed.


The lending program might have done
these things. Doubts are pardonable

Congress cannot be blamed for refus-
ing to take chance on another costly
experiment which, if it failed as most
of them have, would leave the taxpayers
saddled with a burden that would do
anything but reduce taxes.


1t is about time, as congress seems to
be realizing, to leave the matter of re-
covery up to business itself, helping it
along in the best way the federal gov
ernment can by removing from the
minds of business men the paralyzng
fear of more and more taxes, greater
and greater debt, and eventual currency
initiation or downright reputation.

BOSTON, Nov. 4.-Senator Walsh
Democrat, of Massachusetts, took q
train ride today with President
Roosevelt, but was on his way home
to Clinton, Mass, when the Presi-
dent addressed a Democratic rally
in Fenway Park.


Boarding the Presidents specia,
train in Worcester at midafternoon
Senator Walsh said that he was in
Vlted by the President to ride tc
Boston with him and to sit on the
platform at the rally.


But"" he said, I'm going to ride
on the train as far as Boston anC
leave him there. I will not appear
at the rally""


However, when he left the train
at Boston, Senator Walsh said that
many engagements"" prevented hin,
from riding to Fenway Park ano
sitting on the platform with the
President.


Il plan to dine with friends here
In Boston"" Senator Walsh added
In brief statement to reporters
""and then continue on to my home. ;


Senator Walsh earlier had said
that he would leave the train at
Framtngham, about halfway be-
tween Worcester and Boston, but
the Presidential special made nc
stops between those two cities.


Earlier this week Senator Walsh
had expressed resentment at Sena.

Decline to Summon


Naval Commanders",By the Associated Press.,"By the Associated Press.


Chairman Truman announced to-
day the Senate Defense Investigat-
ing Committee would continue its
work during the war, but believes
that it should not investigate mill
tary and naval strategy or tactics""


Therefore, Senator Truman said,
no attempt will be made to inquire
into the circumstances of the jap
anese attack at Pearl Harbor Sum-
day. He made the comment after a
closed committee session called to
determine future policy.


From It's inception"" statement
said, the committee has confined
itself to ""the military aspects
of the defense program, that is to
say, with seeing to it that the de-
tense articles which the Army and
Navy had determined that they need
are produced in a minimum Of time
at minimum of cost and with as
little disruption of the civilian econ
orny as possible""


Walsh Rejects Questioning.


The Senate Naval Affairs Com
mittee said President Roosevelt
must be the Judge of when informa-
ton about war operations should be
given to the American public and
for that reason the Senate commit
tee would make no effort to ques-
ton naval officials.


Senator Walsh said he was salts
fed the President had told all he
could about the Pacific situation.


Meanwhile the House Naval Af-
fairs Committee was called into
executive session to permit members
to question Rear Admiral Ross T.
McIntire, Naval surgeon general, as
to whether the Nays top-ranking
officers are physically fit for war
time duty.


Representative Vincent, Democrat
of Kentucky demanded the oppor-
tunity to interrogate DR.. McIntire
on the subject, asserting, I'VE can't
fight this war with IS or 70 year
old men""


The committee had invited Secre-
tary Knox and Admiral Harold r
Stark, chief of naval operations
to be on hand for the session SO
that they might be questioned as to
how the Japanese managed to de-
liver their surprising and damag-
ing attack on Pearl Harbor.


Vinson Halts Plan.


Chairman VinSon announced late
yesterday, however, that Secretary
Knox would be out of the city today
and that the war with Japan made
it impossible for Admiral Stark to
take time from his official duties to
testify.


President Roosevelt told the Ma
ton in his speech last night, how
ever, that he himself did not vet
have sufficient information on the
Pearl Harbor attack to state the
exact damage done to United States
Warships there. Because of this lack
of information, many lawmakers
considered that any investigation
OF the circumstances of the assault
would be premature.


Representative Vincent had de-
r1anded questioning of the Nays
high command on the Pearl Harbor
attack. declaring that somebody was
asleep"" in Hawaii A short time
later, Representative Dingell, Dem
ocrat, of Michigan told the House he
planned to demand court-martial
proceedings against the ranking Army
and Navy officers involved, a step
which Mr.. Vinson promptly de-
nounced as nothing but a cheap ef-
fort to get newspaper publicity


Representative Dingell was fore
stalled at the close of yesterdays
House session from making a five
minute additional speech on the sub
ject when representative Cole
Democrat, of Maryland forced ad-
journment because a quorum was
lacking.


I'll get five minutes one way or
the other tomorrow to make this
speech in spite of the brass hats, u
stormed Mr.. Dingell a few minutes
later.


Naval Expansion.


Chairman Vinson disclosed yester-
day that the Navy is preparing leg
islation to authorize the building Of
still more combat ships which will
be started just as soon as new or
existing ways are available.


Mr.. Vinson said he would insist
that the new program emphasize
battleships, apparently to offset any
similar construction which Japan
might undertake The Georgian
gave no details of the projected
expansion.


At present, the United States has
about 345 combat ships in the five
major categories-battleships, air.
craft carriers, cruisers, destroyers
and submarines-under construction
and on last Navy Day, October u
the number in service totaled 346.


Asserting that all naval building
now is on a 24-hour-a-da basis
Mr.. Vinson said the forthcoming
legislation might include some pro-
visions for further expediting the
work"

native Americans who owe no allegiance

ceit has been possible, how this reversal
of history has been effected. I believe
the answer has been made by the late
John Buchan, Lord Tweedsmuir, Gov
ernor General of Canada In his His
tory of the Great War;"" he says: She
(America) was|aS yet less a people than
a collection of peoples. Her national
consciousness, so far as political thinking
was concerned. was weak. The Nation
found itself frustrated at every turn by
the state: her racial integration, in spite
of the efforts of her reformers, was in
complete; the centrifugal forces, to use
the common metaphor, were still stronger
than the centripetal; she was less a
unified power than a loose federation.
1t had been different SO years before,
but the America of 1916 was not the
America of 1865. Her enormous increase
in population had given her masses of
men owing diverse allegiances, and,
though she had absorbed them so that
they soon approximated a common
human type, she had not yet given them
common code of political thought. She
was always in danger of becoming what
Mr.. (Theodore) Roosevelt described as a
mere polyglot boarding house.""

The cat looked up, bewildered, as
the fashlight bulbs recorded her
against the background Of the White
House doorsteps. But it did not
frighten her away. She decided to
stick around and see what all the
excitement was about.


When the Ambassador came out,
accompanied by George T. Sum-

State Department, the cat was still
around, and then its big moment
came.


Lord Lothian stopped and picked
it up. He smiled good-naturedly

 Bob Hurley's record is an open book to the working men and women of this state.

free radio facilities and they cannot
very well assume in advance the
things the President might say which
would class his speeches as political.


Thus the country will witness a
full-fedged political campaign trip on
the part of the President and vet
camouflaged as merely the summer
journey of Chief Executive in search
of relaxation. Mr.. Roosevelt WILL to


be, sure, take sea voyage after he


reaches the Pacific Coast, but en-


route across the continent he will


make series of impromptu addresses.


More important politically is the GUS


tom of inviting to his train favorites


inside a State and thus implying to


the voters of the Democratic party


which candidates bask in the sun
light of the presidential smile.


Boldly Uses Device.


Mr.. Roosevelt is by no means the
discoverer Of this technique but no
President in recent years has used it
as boldly. AS matter of fact most
Presidents have felt a certain COM
junction even about campaigning for
their own reelection, let alone striv-
ing to interfere in the election of the
members of a coordinate branch of
the Government. The customary at
titude has been for Presidents to re-
frain from active political campaign
ing after they reach the White House.
The theory that when man reaches
the Presidency he should not use that
Office to influence voters in a political
campaign has been more or less as
sociated with the idea that the presi- |
dental Office is above partisan poll
tics.


Back in 1918 when the late Presi-
dent Wilson called for the election of |
a Democratic Congress, widespread re-
sentiment resulted. No President since |
has repeated that mistake. But it does |
look as If Mr.. Roosevelt is going to |
approximate Mr. Wilson's position by
making trip not only to influence
the choices inside the Democratic |
party, but to lay the foundations for
another campaign in the autumn. Mr..
Roosevelt may be expected to cam
paign openly for the election of New
Deal Senators and Representatives. It
is difficult to see how he can make an
appeal for Democratic"" Congress
as such, because there will be many
Democrats on the ballot who will have
won their respective nominations be-
cause of and in spite of their opposi-
tion to the New Deal.


Example for U. S. Employees.


Mr.. Roosevelt's participation in
party politics is far more important
than a mere indication of presidential
views on current problems. 1t says,
in effect, to Office holders throughout
the country that civil service rules and
previous inhibitions about Federal en-
pleye participation in politics may be
regarded as more or less dead letter.
When the head of the whole Govern
ment uses time-for which he is paid
q S75, 5,000-a-year salary and $4,000
travelling expenses by all the people
not just the New Dealers-to engage
in politics, there is bound to be from
that example an implication that it is
all right for the rank and file to do
likewise and particularly for the Fed
eral Office holders in executive posi-
tions in the various bureaus, commits
sions and agencies scattered in the
5000 or more branches of the Federal
Government throughout the country.


Mr.. Roosevelt may not have given
consideration to the ethics or propriety
of his forthcoming political trip, but
1t is conception of the presidential
Office which will not square with the
record of other Presidents. If his
philosophy becomes the prevailing one
in the White House, the Nation may
expect hereafter to see the White
House used more and more as a
vehicle for partisanship and less and
less in the interest of all the people
irrespective Of party.


Unrepayable Debt.


Such trend leads so naturally to
q White House control of the legis-
lative branch of the Government
for those elected with Presidents
help are forever in his debt-that
1t must inevitably mean breakdown Of |
Government by party and-a substi-
tuition of personal government with
one man as the dictator not only of |
party personnel but public policies.
This is not new either in America.
Boss rule Is a familiar experience in |
States and cities, but It Is somewhat |
novel to have political boss operating
from the Executive Mansion and with |
public funds at his disposal for use in |
political campaigns. Maybe some day
the voters irrespective of party will |
express their revulsion against the use
OF the presidential Office for political
purposes-they have such an oppor-
tunity on two occasions this year-in
the nominating primaries and in the |
autumn elections.

With Fast RambIers
In Anacostia Ti|t",,"Eastern's high-riding Ramblers,
on top of the high school basket
ball loop this morning, eyed a Will
son team that threatened to share
the league lead again by whipping
Anacostia today on the Tech court
The Tigers, making the most of an
early season schedule that has
paired them with low-grade op-
ponents, rated as favorites over the
hapless Indians.


On present form, no one doubts
seriously the Ramblers' ability to
breeze to the championship again
this season, but Tech has popped
up as a quintet that may give East
ern a battle before the hoop shoot
ing is over. Although whipped by
the Ramblers in the first game of
the season, Tech has developed
rapidly and now rates as the top
challenger after knocking Central
off the undefeated list yesterday in
40-to-31 thriller at Tech.


Meanwhile, the Coolidge Colts,
who yet may be contenders in the
race, jumped out of the cellar with
49-to-23 win over Western at
Tech.


Wilson, although undefeated, will
have to rack up win against fast
company before it can be classed
as distinct threat to Eastern's
title hopes. The Eastern five that
rode over a good Roosevelt team,
""a to IA, yesterday on the Rough
Riders court, has too much on the
ball at present, but Wilson still is a
good long-shot bet in an unpre-
dictable schoolboy game.


Ninth in Row for Eastern.


1t was ninth straight win for
Eastern over a desperate Roosevelt
five that makes up for a lack of
redhot talent with good teamwork
and neat passing. Eastern's gifted
stars, Bob Lamon and AL d'Ambro-
sio, however, are in a class by
themselves on the circuit this yea1
and teamwork alone isn't enough to
stop them.


Eastern took the lead early in
the first period on baskets by Lamon
and Eddie Charnock and a free
throw and held it over the route,
although the Rough Riders threat
ened to tie it up in the middle of
the opening heat. Nick Argyro-
poulos, lanky Roosevelt guard,
snaked through the Eastern defense
to hit the cords and Elliot Bushlow
followed with lay-up to put the
Riders within a single point of the
Eastern total.


The Ramblers snapped back.
however, to take a 12-to-4 lead at
the end of the first quarter, fought
off determined Rider attack to
make it 18 to II at the half, held a
25-to-14 advantage at the three
quarter pole and breezed to the
finish.


Lamon was high scorer with five
field goals and two charity shots for
II markers and D'Ambrosio was run
nerup with four goals and two foul
throws for 10 points."

The two sides, so it is said, will
enter the conference with good will
eager to flnd solutions. The Presi-
dent will make an earnest and bal
anced speech tomorrow night -
probably prepared for him by the
same Samuel Rosenman who wrote
so many of the Roosevelt speeches
and messages.


Not Too Optimistic.


Undoubtedly, the conference will
start off auspiciously. The question
is how will 1t end? There is no
sense not facing realities, and the
plain truth is that those who best
know the facts are not too optimis-
tic. If important agreements are
unanimously reached, they will be
agreeably surprised.


The chief reason for this feeling
Is that 1t is lopsided conference.
True, 1t does not look so on the sur
face. The So delegates are evenly
divided between labor and industry.
The presiding officer-one of the
representatives of the public, Judge
Walter Parker Stacey-is an up
right, honorable man, experienced
as an arbitrator and mediator and.
though rather. inclined toward the
labor side, Is acceptable to industry.
But, to be truly balanced confer
ence in which neither side starts
with any advantage, clearly the
Government, under whose auspices
1t is held, should be genuinely and
completely neutral. And that is
Just what the Government is not.


Mr.. Truman's fair words tomorrow
night will not make him a neutral
any more than Mr.. Roosevelt was a
neutral. Mr.. Roosevelt and his
whole administration was openly
linked with labor and against in
dustry in every controversy. The
Roosevelt Attorney General, Fran
els Biddle, in effect, publicly pro-
claimed It,


Linked to CIO. i


Mr.. Truman's tie with the CIO Is
not nearly as close as that of his
predecessor, but there Is a tie. His
Postmaster General and Democratic
chairman, Robert e. Hannegan. is
playing ball"" with the CIO politi-
clans. Mr.. Truman's nomination for
Vice President was cleared through
the CLOS PAC leaders at Chicago.


These leaders already have de-
clared for him as 194s nominee for
President. This is not to say that
Mr.. Truman will say an unneutral
word or perform an unneutral act
In connection with this conference.
1t is to say that he is politically
linked with labor and not with in
dustry. That unmistakable fact
automatically weights the confer
ence on the labor side.


But that Is not all. The other
two representatives of the public
are Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach and Secretary of
Commerce Henry Wallace. They
are supposed to be neutral, too, and
concerned solely with the public In
terests. They are about as neutral
as Sidney Hillman and Philip MUIR
ray. Their link with the CIO is
closer than Mr.. Truman's. Mr.. Wal
lace was the CLOS candidate for
Vice President in 1914 and is still
their ""fair-haired boy"" Mr.. Schwel-
lenbach, as a Senator, was regarded
as CIO adherent and his selection
as Secretary OF Labor was approved
by the CIO leaders.


Concessions by Industry.


Now 1t Is true the Messrs. SchweI-
lenbach and Wallace are non-voting
representatives in the conference;
but, under the agenda which they
helped prepare, they have the privi-
lege Of attending all committee
meetings, executive sessions, and
participating in all proceedings and
debates. They do not need votes.
They will have plenty Of influence
without voting.


As Secretary Of Labor, Mr.. Schwel-
lenbach is supposed to be pro labor:
but as Secretary of Commerce, Mr..
Wallace, naturally, should be mostly
concerned with industry. He isn't.
His head and heart are all on the
labor side. He knows nothing
about industry and has no real
friendship for it. He is congenitally
distrustful of a successful business
man and Is really labor politician.


Considering these facts-and they
are facts-it is difficult to regard
the conference as evenly balanced
between industry and labor, because
the administration weight is on the
labor side. Clearly, if concessions
are to be made they will come large
ly frow industry. Inevitably, recall
citraneS on the part of industry will
be more severely frowned upon than
labor recalcitrancy. It always is
now by our politicians.


In the days when labor unions
were puny and poor, that was right.
But now that they are rich and
strong Il tends tn increase their ar."

gresham T. Alan Goldsborough to
the Federal Bench, and in anticipa-
tion of this there has been much dis
cussion in all parts of the Eastern
Shore as to Congressman Goldsbor-
ough's successor. Prominent among
those mentioned as likely candidates
has been the name of Senator Olin
R. Higgins, of Hurlock.


Many of Senator Higgins friends
have already called upon him to urge
him to run for this important posi-
tion, and he is known to be taking
kindly to the suggestion. If the ap-
pointment of Congressman Goldsbor-
ough takes place, it seems certain that
he will be a cindidate, and that he
will have the support of many promi-
nent Democrats of his own county as
well as of the other counties on the
Shore.


Senator Higgins has long been ac-
lively interested in the public affairs
of his county and his record of SER
vice is an enviable one. A resident
of Hurlock, he is a former member
of the Town Council, a member of
the Chamber of Commerce, of the
Lions International, of the Cambridge
Rotary Club, and is former chair
man of the Dorchester District Boy
Scouts of America. He is Past Mas
ter of the Masonic Lodge and Past
President of the Dorchester and Car
oline County Past Masters Associa-
tion.


He has for many years been es-
pecially interested in the public school
system and was the first President of
the Dorchester County Parent-each-
ers Association and the first Presi-
dent of the Hurlock ent-Teachers
Association. In 1924 Governor Rit-
chic appointed him to be member
of the Dorchester County School
Board, where his services proved to
be of great value, and where he gave
unstintingly of his time toward the
improvement of our county schools.


In 1884 Senator Higgins was elect
ed to the State Senate from Dorches-
ter county and served in that office
for the last five sessions of the Mary
land Legislature He was not a cam
didate for reelection.


His record in the Maryland Senate
was a distinguished one, and his work
there was of lasting benefit to his
county and his State. AS the chair
man of the important Committee on
the Chesapeake Bay and its Tribu-
taries, he steadfastly stood for the
interests of the watermen of the State
and for legislation that would benefit
those interests. He served also on
other important committees, including
those on Finance and Agriculture,
and was a member of all conference
committees for discussing and adjust
ing differences between the Senate
and the House of Delegates.


It was principally through his eff
forts that the new bridge across the
Cambridge Creek was definitely as
sured by the State Roads Commission

This means that IS per cent of
Americas trade with Europe is now
hanging in the balance and will be
impaired by the war to as great an
extent as the British and German
Navies, respectively, can apply their
so-called ""contraband"" lists.


The United States has in the past
protested when belligerents classi-
fled contraband too broadly, but in
the present spirit of Congress, which
is to narrow neutral rights and give
free rein to belligerent navies, the
tendency is not to protest.


Thus, while the neutrality debate
is very interesting and much will be
said about keeping America out of
war or dragging her in, the truth
is the unemployment relief rolls will
tend to grow and the losses to
American business will increase in
accordance as America ignores her
own trade.


Involves Great Expense.


The present sentiment of the
country is to shut off supplies from
the belligerents if it may mean in
volvement in war. That is an under
standable policy, of course, but it is
going to involve an expense far
greater than is generally realized.
The Roosevelt administration will
have the best alibi ever given it in
six years when it comes to talking
of balanced budget. For it will be
easy to point to the declining figures
of American trade and insist that
only by more w. P. A. and more
P. w. A. can the difference be met


Likewise, 1t would not be surpris-
ing to see a recommendation for
drastic tax increases. The fact that
; Great Britain is taxing around IS
per cent for low as we'll as high in
comes is being taken into considera-
ton as likely to induce more CO.
operation hereafter from the tax
payer, especially when America is
not being asked at the same time to
sacrifice human lives.


Even if the embargo is repealed,
the impact on American trade is
bound to be severe until such time
as the supremacy of the British
Navy is assured. If the British Navy
is in process of being defeated, the
American trade will be paralyzed
though, to be sure, the commerce
with South America will continue
as heretofore.


Will Prevent Rise in Exports.


But to put into jeopardy more
than $1,000,000,000 worth Of trade
to Europe alone is something
America has not experienced since
1914, and though war orders have
been expected to make up the diff
ference, it will be evident in a few
months that the cash-and-
plan and other restrictions being
imposed now will prevent the rapid
rise in exports which America ex-
perienced after the first seven
months of disruption of trade begin
ming in August, 1914.


1t is not generally realized that
the United States in December, 1914,
sent one of the Severest protests to
the British that American diplomacy
records. Interference with Ameri-
can shipping to neutral countries
was so extensive that serious rift
in British-American relations might
have resulted if it had not been for
the greater transgression which
arose out of the attack without
warning by German submarines on
American ships and American citi-
Zens.


The United States was in the
midst OF severe slump in trade in
the first seven months of the war
and German submarines were not
as active then as they are today.
With the tendency to squelch war
trade and the tendency also to re-
main indifferent to Interruptions of
ordinary trade, the United States
is bound to suffer economic reverses
unless the seas are cleared for trade.


British News Is Hopeful.


Announcement by the British ad-
miralty that vessels conveyed have
not been successfully attacked for
a week Is more important news to
the American farmer, the American
producer and the American manu.
facturer than how the tide goes In
the United States Senate on the
subject of neutrality revision. For
as IN 1915 and 1916, the prosperity
of the United States is interviewer
with the effectiveness of the British
Navy against German submarines.


Within few weeks after the pres
ent neutrality issue has been laid
aside. the question of the effect of
the war on Americas economic situ-
alton Is likely to be of much more
concern to the American people
than the battles on the western
front. Eventual prosperity, based

charged with the electricity of war.


Secretary Knox said in a COM
mencement address that this Ma
tion, in the postwar period, should
refrain from attempting to enforce
its system of democracy on all the
peoples of the world in order to
insure their freedom.


Democracy, we think, is the best
possible soil in which to cultivate
human freedom. but that is not
necessarily so"" he asserted. ""Au that
we can do, all that we should at
tempt, in the fateful years which
will follow the conclusion OF the
war. is to help create an era OF
tranquility: to foster wholesome
economic order; to elevate living
standards and reduce want and pri-
vation; to promote the spread OF
education and understanding; to re-
build, with all of the wisdom We can
command a fabric of international
law, and to compel its observance,
by force If necessary.


Given this"" he added, the peo-
pies OF the world must first develop
and then maintain bv their own ef-
forts the freedoms they would en-
joy""


Asserting that I'VE can win the
victory and still lose the war;"" Mr..
Knox said we should insure our
selves against new aggressions by
helping maintain an adequate mil
itary force to police the world,
but he declared we should not seek
to make America ""a happy island
of prosperity in an ocean OF pow
erty.""


Stimson Lauds President.


In an address at the alumni
luncheon Secretary Stimson asserted
that the courage and determination
OF President Roosevelt were fur
nishing the leadership which will
achieve the final victory of the war""


His clarity Of foresight and his
unfailing grasp Of the essential
strategic factors Of a worldwide
struggle, YOU have all been able to
follow"" the War Department chief
said. But only those who have been
his Heutenants in the struggle can
know the close personal attention
with which he has vitalized every
important decision. And only they
can fully appreciate the courage
and determination he has shown IN
time OF threatened disaster. or the
loyalty and consideration by which
he has won the support OF all his
war associates. Out OF these charac-
teristics comes the leadership which
will achieve the final victory

From Soldiers to


Be Counted Friduy",,"Be Counted Friday
Montgomery County citizens, by
. vote of 14,471 to 1920, apparently
have rejected charter form of gov
ernment to replace the present
county commissioner plan in the
county, according to unofiicial re-
turns from the county's 81 precincts.


Defeat of the charter cannot be
considered final, however, until the
approximately $500 absentee soldier
votes are counted. But anti-charter
forces are confident that the soldier
vote will not alter the final result.
Members of the County Board Of
Election Supervisors said they ex-
pect to count the soldier vote Friday
Charter advocates, although con-
ceding defeat, indicated that an
other attempt would be made to
bring the charter proposal before
the voters.


i GOP-Democrat Plot Charged.
4 A pro-charter spokesman charged
that the county Democratic organi-
zation had engineered a deap with
Republicans in which the former
had agreed not to support President
Roosevelt in return for Republican
opposition to the charter. The
President lost the county by a vote
Of 14,301 to 1854 for Gov. Dewey.
\ Col. E. Brooke Lee, county Demo-
cratic leader, termed the charge
absolutely false"" He pointed out
that the vote for President Roose-
welt represented a reduction of
only 871 from his 1910 vote
of 15,180 in the county. He added
that his newspaper, the Maryland
News. consistently has called for
the Presidents reelection.


Advocates Plan New Attempt.


''The charter cause was good but
our efforts were not as effective in
votes as those of the machine"" F""
Allen H. Gardner. president of the
County Charter Committee de-
clared. Montgomery citizens who
want charter will not be discour-
aged. Charters have often lost in
the first vote for adoption. An
other year will come""


From Judge Albert E. Brault, ex-
kcutive secretary Of the Citizens
Committee to Defeat Charter, came
The following statement:


1--WE exerted our best efforts to
defeat the charter because we hon.
estly believe the present system Of
county government is completely
adequate, with record of good re-
suits.


""We felt the proposed charter
was an experiment which was not
justified in view of the splendid
governmental conditions existing In
the county at this time""

They were Prince Georges, Cecil,

Wicomico.


In 1910 only five counties in the
State went Republican. They were

The old theory that you ""can
prove anything with figures"" has
been working overtime here during
the past few weeks as various de-
partments of the government and
individual analysts have issued
totally conflicting figures on our
defense production. on the extent
of production delays caused by
labor troubles, on the shortage of
gasoline in the East and on other
matters of paramount concern to
all of US.


After hearing the various figures
banded about. most of us who are
seeking the facts here are left In
state of total confusion.


Discussion on production figures
was brought into the limelight two
weeks ago, when Senator Byrd OF
Virginia and President Roosevelt
cot into a much-publicized squab
BILE. both quoting totally different
figures on prohibition and both
quoting reliable sources from
which they got their figures.
But giving the President the
benefit of the doubt, even his IL
cures indicate that the amount oil
materials we have sent to Britain
so far is nothing to brag about
The President admitted that it has
not been satisfactory, although he
said in most cases it has been up
| to estimates.


Plane and tank production is the
leading topic of debate, and al
though the figures on this are moi
clear, it is evident that there has
been no monthly increase in plane
production during the past three
months and there has probably

Etiquette department: Most au-
diences one encounters in the the
ater are just audiences, but that one
at the National last Tuesday night
is one we shall not forget. It was
one of the most pleasant, gracious
groups we ever sat with, and we
have been intending to say so the
first gap that occurred in our per-
sonal newprint situation.


The particular manifestation of
grace was the applause which greet
ed Ronnie Cunningham, ballerina,
who fell during her first number. 1t
was a virtual ovation Miss Cunning
ham received when she reappeared
after just split second in the wings,
and she deserved it.


Investigation disclosed-if you
wondered why several others slipped
on that stage that night-that the
company management had request
ed the stage be mopped just an
hour before the performance. 1t was
mopped and remained in the condi-
ton of stage that has just been
mopped for some time after the
performance started.


# you were in that audience, we
thought you might like to know
what caused Miss c. and the others
to slip.


Promotion department: Ever since
she became Mrs. Elliott Roosevelt,
Faye Emerson has been becoming
larger in the type advertising pic
lures in which she appeared. Warm
er Bros almost at once announced
her promotion to star dimensions,
but Miss Emerson's roles were not
actually of that caliber in those
then n-being released pictures.


She really becomes the principal
feminine performer in her next
picture. 1t is called Danger Sig
nal' and will present Zachary Scott
in the stellar male part.


Play department: Ira Wolfert,
the prewar representative of this |
in New York, will be
represented by play on Broadway
this fall. 1t will be a drama based |
upon Wolfert's novel, fuckers
People"" The adaptation is by FL
ner Rice and the Playwrights' Co.,
Of which Rice is a member, will
sponsor the production.

butter, apparently unaffected by
efforts in Washington to put them
under a ceiling, keep right on going
up, and closed yesterday consider
ably higher than when President

and Minnesota, two great producing
States, may be diverted either East
or West, and the comparative at

granting Of powers. To be sure,
some of the members absented
themselves, but in doing SO they
saw fit to leave the city completely.
The pro-war sentiment was running
too strong for opposition.


The Germans had misjudged their
Mexico. They thought that by sink
ing the two Mexican tankers they
would not only cut of that much
oil from the United States, but
would also put a scare into Mexico.
But when the flag which every
Mexican loves with patriotic fervor
was dragged down into the waters OF
the Gulf, wave Of unity swept the
country like that which swept the
United States after Pearl Harbor.


Seine Blamed America.


There was moment, however,
when some persons blamed the
United States for sinking the ships.
This fantastic notion was credit
to the success Of German prop
aganda. For years, the Germans
have poured money into Mexico to
keep fresh the old wounds of anti
Yanquis"" feeling. Certain Mexican
newspaper editors believed-and SO
wrote in the press-that the future
Of Mexico lay in German conquest
In the present war, to liberate,
Mexico from ""Yanquis imperialism""


The crew of the tanker ""Faja de
Oro."" like many humble Mexicans,
were so far persuaded of Germanys
good intentions toward Mexico that
when the ship was sunk they con-
cluded the attacking submarine
must have been American. This was
promptly dismissed as an absurdity,
however, and feeling began to shift
at oncee.


The change was observed by the
American Embassy here, which
watches the reaction of cinema
patrons. For long time, German
agents had stimulated demonstra-
tons in cinema houses against all
things American, British or Russian.
But after the tanker sinkings, a
newsreel was displayed in Mexico
City which had shots of President
Roosevelt pinning medal on Brig.
Gen. Doolittle. There were no boos
this time. The crowd roared their
applause."

Ry the Associated Press.


LONDON, May 2-.-An oral agree
ment between Britain and Italy over
the delicate issue of Palestine was
disclosed by Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain in the House of Com
mons today as he faced an opposition
onslaught on the Anglo-Italian pact
signed at Rome April 16.


The two powers had exchanged as
surances that interests of the other in
Palsetine would be respected. Mr..
Chamberlain announced.
/ Vigorously defending his policy Of
realistic dealing with Europe's dicta-
tors, the prime minister said the
Rome agreement was the first great
step toward ""saner state in Europe""


Mr.. CHAMBERLAIN closed his 43-min-
ute speech by ""repudiating"" the idea
that ''it is impossible for democracy
to come to terms and understanding
with states Of authoritarian ideas""


War Danger Cited.


Hyo r1i l,o J, t,A>
came Prime Minister IL months ago
Britain and Italy were drifting rapidly
toward war and that relations Of the
two powers were 80 unsatisfactory,
even so dangerous, it was necessary to
make some effort to improve them""


Mr.. Chamberlain cited President
Roosevelt's approval Of the Anglo
Italian accord.


The President of the United States
signified his sympathetic interest be-
cause he considers this affords proof
of the value of peaceful negotiations""
the prime minister said.


A bitter opposition attack was
launched by Herbert Morrison, Labor
ite, who said


llc WlOIlsS Ol OpdlIl dllu AUy SSIllld
(Ethiopia) constitute a disgrace to
the honor of this country. It
(the pac) is an open betrayal Of con-
stitutional Spain and a positive incite-
ment to Germany and Italy to make
Franco (the Spanish insurgent leader)
win quickly""


Grandi Cheered.


Conservative members cheered the
Italian Ambassador, Count Dino
Grandi, who followed the debate in
tently from the diplomatic gallery.
when the prime minister praised his
part in the negotiations.


Mr.. Chamberlain disclosed for the
first time that Italy gave Britain as
surances that the Italian government
will abstain from creating difficulties
or embarrassments for the British
government in the administration Of
Palestine""


Government benches cheered this
announcement Palestine was not
mentioned in the formal Anglo italian
agreement.


Mr. Chamberlain said that In re-
turn Britain gave Italy similar oral
assurance that Britain intended to
preserve and protect legitimate Italian
interests in Palestine"""

Suffrage Is Essential

tic measures"" to bring the Districts S
""long-neglected' institutions up to
date and added that the further
she looks. the more she is convinced
that suffrage is essential for the
District.


She told her press conference too
much of the money spent here goes
for public buildings which visitors
can see and admire, instead of for
the city's institutions.


Washington is such a beautiful
CITY,"" she declared. That's why it
is so pathetic that things which
deal with human beings are so de-
plorable""


Conditions of District institutions,
she asserted, have been getting
worse over long period Of years
and now have reached a state which
will require large capital ex-
penditure before they are COM
pletely remedied.


Compared With States.


She compared District institu-
tions with those in the States after
the World War. Building during
the war had been neglected. she
said, so that when people looked
around after the war they found
horrible conditions, lack of facili-
ties and general overcrowding.


1t required a large appropriation
in almost every State to make up
for what had been neglected during
the war.


THE situation here is exactly
analogous"" she declared. You
don't touch anything which isn't
the result of long neglect""


She used as an example the fact
that seven girls were confined in
cells at the National Training
School at the time of the fire last
week. She said she had never
heard of more than two girls in the
cells and indicated that lack Of
funds caused the discomfort which
sent the girls into confinement.


Drastic measures will have to be
faced and taken jointly by Congress
and the people of Washington before
conditions are improved here, she
declared.


Sense of Responsibility.


It was in this connection that she
said she had become convinced that
the District should have a vote to
give citizens of the District a sense
of responsibility for their institu-
tions.

A hurried consultation of officials

ONGREss has become suddenly
super-highway conscious


~ For . number of years sporadic
attempts have been made In House or SEN
ate to start q network OF transcontinental
boulevards, separated from all grade cross
ings. avoiding city congestion and, in most
cases, to be self-hquidating through toll
charges. Until recently, however, these
proposals were like 20 many other bills that
are introduced. considered and then filed
away for future reference.


When business began to slip backward
several months ago lawmakers and econ
omists began to look about for new ways
to prime the pump, and, along with other
proposals, the first month of the present
session brought forth q crop of new SUPER
highway bills.


Like the new housing law lberalizing
Government insurance Of home mortgages,
most Of the highway plans are intended to
be largely self-supporting, as distinguished
from the outright grant method 80 gener-
ally used in fighting depression since 1888.


Federal Aid Popular.


During the special session last fall Presi-
dent Roosevelt asked Congress to slow down
the regular Federal-aid highway program
as one means of bringing the budget closer
to balance. He suggested specifically that
no allotments be made for the coming fiscal
year and that new authorizations for the
next few years be reduced.


Needless to say, the regular Federal-aid
program Is extremely popular at the Capt.
tol. since it means Federal matching of
State expenditures on main arteries Ac-
cordinsly. Congress has not yet acted on
tho suggestion to forego allotments for
the new authorizations for the fiscal years
1910 and 194l, now pending, will be re-
duced materially In amount


Nevertheless, the Presidents appeal for
curtailment Of direct grants stimulated in
terest in the idea Of building self-liquidat-
ing highways from ocean to ocean and
from the northern boundary to the Gulf
ports. More recently the super-highway
movement gained impetus on the Hill when
the President, while not definitely commit
ting himself, indicated an interest in its
possibilities, especially the excess-con-
demnation method of development. Under
that method the Government would ac-
quire 4 wider right of way than would be
needed for highway purposes and dispose
Of the abutting property later IS q means
of helping to finance the program.


Washington 10 Be Linked.


Whenever the super highway plan does
materialize it Is virtually certain Wash
ington will be linked into the system. Two
of the pending bills, which undertake to
specify exact routes, include the District
put the Nations Capital on their itinerary.
In addition, q large volume of motor
trucking between Northern and Southern
points passes through the District. Even
before the super highway program began
to gain its recent momentum there was
talk in Congress of building q highway
tnat would carry through trafic from
Maryland to the Highway Bridge on the
outskirts Of the congested area of the city.


Most Of the pending plans call for three
East-West transcontinental boulevards.
with six or seven running north and
south. Estimates Of cost, over an ex-
tended period Of years, run as high as
$4,000, 100000


Creation Of employment both on the
roads and in factories is the immediate
incentive for the proposed legislation, but
some Of the sponsors cite also the value
of these major highways in the system
Of national defense, rs we'll as = means OF
promoting highway safety.


The first definite move In the considera-
ton Of the subject will be the opening
of public hearings Wednesday before
Senate subcommittee on the bill Of Senator
Bulkley, Democrat, Of Ohio. This measure
would create the United States Highway
Corp, with not more than 500 100000 OF
capital stock, and authority to issue up
to s2.ooo, 900 900 Of bonds to obtain funds
to carry On the highway program.


sse-Fsot Rights sf Way.


The Bulkley bill and some Of the others
avoid possible controversy over routes Dy
leaving detsiled plans to governmental
agencies. The Bulkley measure, which
Was introduced after the Ohioan had con-
ferred with the President. calls for rights
Of way at least 500 feet wide, with from
TO IL one-way paved lanes depending
upon traf1ic in given areas. Buses ana
passenger cars would be separated from
trucks, curves would be eliminated Is far
as possible. and there would be no erade
crossings. either 1T railroads or intersectins
highways.


The toll rates would be fixed by the
highway agency with view to covering
maintenance, policing and retirement OF
the construction bonds.


The Bulkley bill also covers the excess

Though the United States has vast
petroleum resources, and splendidly
equipped industry, Federal action is
plainly needed, in the present emer-
gency, to assure that an adequate
supply of petroleum and its products
be available at all times to meet
military and essential civilian re-
quirements. In designating Secre-
tary IckeS as petroleum co-ordinator
for national defense, President
Roosevelt has recognized this need.
Mr.. IckeS has been vested with broad
powers to secure the development
and utilization, with the maximum
efficiency, of our petroleum resources
and production facilities, and in
carrying out his new duties he pre-
sumably will have the authority, if
necessary, to place restrictions on the
use of petroleum products by civil
ians.


According to estimates Of Govern
ment experts, the domestic demand
for petroleum this year will run
about ten per cent above 1910 con-
sumption. Part Of this increase is
due to the expanding demands of
the armed services. So far as prac-
ticable, the Army is replacing ami
mal-drawn transportation with mo-
torized equipment. BY the end OF
the summer, or early in the fall, the
Army will have 2S6,O00 motor We
hicles, as compared with $4,000 early
in 1910. Many new ships are being
added to the Navy and thousands of
airplanes to our air fleets. The re-
armament program has thus greatly
increased the military demand for
petroleum and its products, and this
demand will progressively increase.


Transportation is the principal
""bottleneck"" that will face Secretary
Ickes as petroleum co-ordinator.
Ample stores of petroleum are on
hand in the United States, but under
present conditions it may not be easy
to make these available quickly at
the points where they are needed.
About 95 per cent of the petroleum
consumed by States along the At
lantic Seaboard is delivered to this
area by tankers. The movement
from the Gulf Coast alone amounts
to 1,250O00 barrels day and requires
the services of about $50 domestic
tankers. Since one-ffth of the
available tanker fleet has been di-
verted to the British supply service,
transportation already presents
difficult problem. Construction of
pipe lines to the East is under con-
sideration, but this would require
time and would not Immediately
provide solution for the tranSporta-
ton problem.


If petroleum products cannot be
moved into the East Coast region
in sufficient volume to meet military
and civilian demands, a curtailment
of non-defense consumption will be
necessary to assure uninterrupted
production of war materials. In
meeting the threat of Axis aggres-
sion, the American people will be
called upon both for sacrifices and
readjustments in their daily lives.
Mr.. Ickes has already limited at the
possibility of ""gasless"" Sundays.
Restrictions on the consumption of
other commodities may also be
needed to secure the full mobilization
of the Nations war potential."

 Briefly put, it boils down to the fact that General Stilwell served an ultimatum on Generalissimo Chiang- to cooperate with other Chinese armies in wag- ing war against Japan, and you can't serve ultimatums on the head of another government.

 U. s. Ambassador Clarence Gauss also called on the Gener- alissimo regarding the same ques- tion of cooperation, but being diplomat he merely suggested.

 Actually, the controversy re- wolves around question discussed by this writer last summer, in a column vigorously criticized by the Chinese, reporting that most of the real fighting against the Japs had been done by the North ern Chinese so-called Communist Army. Chiang Kai-shek's war lords, on the other hand, have fought the so-called Communists, thus indirectly aiding the Japs.

 Vice President Wallace, inci- dentally, had an indirect hand in the Stilwell controversy and, strangely enough, he and acid- tongued Vinegar Joe"" found themselves in basic agreement. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED

 Here is the rather complicated story of what happened:

 Two years ago party of Amer jeans, fleeing from the Japs af- ter Pearl Harbor, travelled through northern China With the assist ance of Chinese Communist guer- rilas, got a detailed picture of guerrilla effectiveness, later made a report to Roosevelt, who was impressed with their findings.

 Later, when Madame Chiang Kai-shek came here on her first visit, FDR questioned her at length regarding the guerrilla army. She dismissed the whole idea as Communist propaganda, claimed no such army really ex- iSted.

 But Roosevelt, not satisfied, called in MariEe Corps Colonel

 Evans Carlson, hero of Maxim Island, who had spent several years with the Chinese Com munists. Carlson confirmed that they were the most effec- tive army in China.

 Finally, last spring, Roosevelt sent Wallace to China, specifically instructed him to arrange for a U. s. military mission to visit the Communist Army. This was not easy. First, Wallace got Chiang's permission to visit the Commun- ists. Later, he had to get per- mission from the Communist guerillas to receive an American military mission. This was really difficult.

 At first, the Communists were skeptical, but after considerable Vice Presidential persuasion, they agreed.

 COMMUNISTS GOOD FIGHTERS

 That mission last summer re- ported directly to the White House, confirming previous ideas that CD the Chinese Commun- ists have about 500,000 loyal troops, though poorly equipped; CD they have another 100000 potential fighters now doing guerrilla work behind Jap lines; (S) they have superior intelligence regarding Jap operations; (4) their comman- der, Tse-tung, has brilliant rec ord of resisting the Japs to the last ditch.

 Result of all this was that the United States faced the all formative of working directly with the Communists, which would affect Chiang Kai-shek,, or of trying to get Chiang Kali shek t0 work with them so the"

are seeking to promote through the

ratify the treaty by an overwhelm-
ing vote""


Overcoming their hesitancy to
speak out on such a far-reaching
subject after only three weeks in
the Senate, the 16 decided that the
President ought to know their views
before his momentous talks with
Premier Stain and Prime Minister
Churchill.


In addition to favoring formation
""at the earliest possible moment"" of
q United Nations organization to
keep the peace, the signers stated
their belief that this Government
should use all reasonable means to
assure our Allies and the other ma
tions of the world that we intend to
share in the direction of and the
responsibility for the settlement of
this war and the maintenance of
peace""


Then, in line with the principles
enunciated by Republican Senator
Vandenberg of Michigan in his re-

asked for the early conclusion of

militarized. @

Mediation Co|Iopses, Sending
Wage Deadlock to President

Foct-Findine Boord
Is Next Step Indicated
In Poy Dispute",ny the Associated Press.,"BY the Associated Press.


CHICAGO, Sept. 5.-Mediation
OF the wage dispute between the
Nations major railroads and
their 1850, 900 employees ended in
failure today, less than three
hours after the employees had
given q general strike authorize =
ton to their 10 unions.


In announcing that attempts to
reach an amicable settlement OF the
dispute had ended. the National
Railway Mediation Board disclosed
that an offer of arbitration had been
rejected by the unions.


This brings the controversy to
President Roosevelt, who has the
authority TO appoint an emergency
fact-finding board. No strike may
be put into effect until at least 80
days after this board has reported.


Brotherhoods Are Adamant.


The five big operating brother
hoods stand sdsmant for q 80 per
cent increase In the basic rates Of
pay. Fourteen incorporating I'M
ions want increases which will boost
the wages of their members from 80
to ""a cents an hour. The non-op-
Grating unions, embracing approx
mately 100000 workers, have set
September IL as the date for a
strike. The operating brotherhoods
planned to set their date within
three or four days


After reciting the history OF at
tempts to settle the dispute, the
Mediation Boards statement said,
In part: ..


1T developed yesterday that me-
diation, in the judgment Of the
board. was no longer helpful. AS a
consequence, under the law, the
board requested the parties to enter
into agreements to arbitrate their
differences. The board was unable
to bring the parties into agreement
to arbitrate""


The board announced that 1t
would not notify the President OF
the abandonment OF mediation ef-
forts until after 1t had received
notice of the operating unions
strike date.


Expresses Disappointment.


Fred G. Gurley, chairman of the
carriers Joint Conference Commit
tee, expressed disappointment at the
failure TO reach an amicable settle
ment.


He said that after the Mediation
Board announced its intention OF
closing its conferences, the railroads
expressed 4 willingness to arbitrate
the controversy, but that the unions
exercised their right to reject this
procedure.


The operating unions, however
have agreed to further mediation
of the carriers proposals for rules
changes after the wage question
has been settled, Mr.. Gurley said
10 this phase of the dispute would
not be considered by the fact-flnd-
ing board as it applies to the op.
Grating unions. The incorporating
unions have consistently refused
to discuss rule changes, Mr.. Gurley
added.


He asserted that the strike vote
vas a device of the employees tc
create an emergency which would
cause the President to appoint q
fact-finding board.


Its merely ballot for a fact
finding board and not a ballot fol
q strike"" he said.


Oficials of the five operating
groups said that es.7 of their $4,000
members voted in favor of strike
and that preliminary figures on q
strike authorization vote showed that
out OF 287,000 votes cast, 283,42s
were for q strike and 3,571 were
against.


Alvaney Johnston, head of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi-
neers, said that the operating unions
would announce date for strike
within three days.


Mr.. Johnston said the carriers
made a final wage offer before the
strike votes were announced. He
said that it was so complicated I'VE
consider it no offer at all""

Expected 10 Settle
T.. T.. C.-N. Y. A. Issue

Senote Committee on
Education Considers
Defense Work Retention",BY J. A. O'LEARY.,"The debate going on in the Senate
Education and Labor Committee
over the extent to which the N. Y. A.
and C. C. c. programs could be
curtailed during the war is expected
to be settled finally in the Appro-
priation Committees Of the House
and Senate.


The bill originally introduced by
Senator McKellar, Democrat, Of
Tennessee. proposed that both
agencies be terminated this year.
but as the hearings have progressed
the Tennessean has offered two
amendments to preserve, on re-
duced scale, essential defense ac-
tivities


When the education and labor
group recessed late yesterday to
resume hearings tomorrow, the
situation could be summed up as
follows:


President Roosevelt was on record
in a letter as opposed to the termi-
nation Of the agencies. pointing out
that the N. Y. A. is slated to train
600 900 youth in 1943 for essential
defense work. and that c. C. C. is
working on Army reservations, with
its other projects now limited to
phases essential to the war effort.


McNutt Questioned.


Federal Security Administrator Nc
Mutt, who has general jurisdiction
over N. Y. A., C. c. c. and the voca-
tional training of the once of
Education. was on record as willing
to see N. Y. A. and C. c. c. merged,
but warning it would be unwise to
combine this phase of defense train
Ing with the Office of Education.


Senators McKellar and Byrd,
Democrat. of Virginia have made it
clear they are not opposing training
persons for defense industries, but
contended, in croSs-examining Mr..
McNutt. that one combined agency
could direct all such training.


Mr. McNutt testified 1t has been
estimated America will need to train
1000 900 persons, young men and
women. for the home front-for
work in war industries-and that
facilities are not available to train
them in one year. The Security
Administrator said also that before
Pearl Harbor his agency had be-
gun to eliminate parts of the youth
aid programs not essential to an
all-out war effort.


Regardless of what the Educa-
tion and Labor Committee does
with the McKellar bill, however,
the Appropriation Committees Of
the two houses will decide between
now and June 80 how much money
to allow for the type of defense
training now carried on by N. Y. A.
and c. c. C."

specific issues, argument continued

trying to get us in through the back
door"" and Senator Wheeler's pre-
diction that not more than Is Sena-

Insists Public Opposes War.


Senator Pepper said there would
be no question of war if Senator
Wheeler and those sharing his
views would support the administra-
ton policy because IF they would
give support, think we could keep
the japanese from advancing to the
southwark and we could deliver our
goods to the British""

shaping up into small group that con-
sists Of President Roosevelt and three
principal aides. These men hold the real
power and make the decisions that
others then execute. On their ability
and Judgment depends the course of
American action in the war.


Mr.. Roosevelt, definitely, is running
the war. He is making the decisions on
strategy, not the generals or admirals.
He is deciding the questions of world
politics that bulk so large in their in
fluence on the wars trend. His is the
final say on which individuals and which
groups will play major part in the
war effort.


One man cannot make all of the de-
cisions and carry all of the load. AS his
key assistant, the President has chosen
Harry Hopkins. Mr.. Hopkins is trusted
implicitly by President Roosevelt. He
lives at the White House and although
not In good health, accomplishes great
amount Of work. The power he wields
in determining the direction of flow of
American war materials and in deciding
which individuals are to hold key jobs is
immense. The two top jobs are those
involving exercise of power over prices
and the distribution of goods and the
power over American industry.
Leon Henderson, close friend OF
Harry Hopkins and formerly his eco
! nomic adviser in W. P A., holds the first
OF these jobs. Mr.. Henderson's powers
in
part from the new price control law
that he administers and in part from
his friendship with Mr.. Hopkins, who,
In turn, Is very close to the President.
1t is this friendship that had much to
do with the selection Of the third man
in the real war cabinet


The third member is Donald Nelson,
who heads the War Production Board
and who holds dictatorial powers over
American industry Mr.. Nelson Is an old
friend of Leon Henderson and owes his
present position, in important part, to
the recognition by Mr.. Henderson Of his
ability.


This, then, is the closely knit little
group that really runs the war effort.
1t is group that, except for Mr.. Nelson,
carries very strong New Deal viewpoint.
Yet, throughout, it is group that from
the first has been right in its appraisal
Of the course Of the war and of the de-
mands that war would make upon the
United States. Every one in the group
is ready to be ruthless in the exercise Of
power If that is what the war requires.
The temporizing policies of previous
leaders get no support from those who
now control.


But what of the military leaders and
of the regular members OF the Presidents S
ordinary cabinet?


AS for the military leaders. Mr.. Roose-
welt is in constant contact with Gen.
| George c. Marshall, who runs the Army
and with Admirals Ernest King and
Harold Stark who run the Navy. He
receives their advice. He respects their
| judgment. But the President makes the
decisions. He really is this country's uni
fed command at the very top. If issues
arise between the Army and Navy, he
resolves them. If there is argument over
whether the Army or Navy should have
priority or over the distribution of arms
between the forces of foreign nations
and the United States. Mr.. Roosevelt
| decides the argument.


AS for the cabinet. individual members
WELD power and influence in their par
ticular fields. AS group, however, the
President depends relatively little upon
| IHCTney1t Spl-
dom influences decisions of major i'm
portance. Cabinet members, like gen.
erals and admirals, can offer their sug-
| gestions and advice and can even argue,
but President Roosevelt does the decid-
ing. Among cabinet members the most
influential are Jesse Jones and Henry L.
Stimson.


What then of the policies Of Mr.
Roosevelt and his war cabinet?


In economic policy, the attitude Is
rather New Dealish. Here advanced
viewpoints and young men get their
chance. There definitely is an attitude
that the friendship of organized labor
is basic to any successful waging OF the
present war. Money and money power
carry far less weight Management Is
respected and its cooperation is sought
The President insists that the position
of workers in relation to other groups
in the population must be improved. he
notes this trend even in the conservative
government Of England.


In military policy, the President Is
definite conservative. He shows little
confidence in young leaders, in sharp
contrast to his attitude in fields OF eco
nonic control. The generals and ad-
mirals on whom he depends are all near
the retirement age. The President prloes
himself upon his ability as strateglst
and this ability was gained in the last
war and is based upon the ideas of the
last war. Mr. Roosevelt, in other WORDS,
is like most Of this country's top-ranking
military and naval leaders in his look
backward to the good old days when the
lessons learned in youth still could be
applied. 1t was we'll along in 1910 when
the President strongly discounted in
press conference the influence OF the
airplane on naval warfare and took his
stand firmly for big battleships and
questioning attitude toward the ef1ec-
tivenesS of aircraft.


There are signs that Mr.. Roosevelt
now has a somewhat different attitude
toward the Importance of aircraft IN
naval warfare However. there are no
signs that the American Navy is con-
vinced of the importance of the plane
as powerful offensive weapon or that
vi, Uoira in naval"

 Hartford turned over the shares to Jones when he received the $4,OOO. Elliott himself testified that the 1914 value of the stock was $l0O a share.

the emergency powers vested
in him when the emergencies no
longer exist. To these people
the question Of voting next
month offers no problem. There
are schools of thought, however,
where the feeling is that too much
authority has been vested in the
President. They feel that
President Roosevelt has yet to
voluntarily relinquish any au-
thority given him under national
emergency legislation and that
he will not do so in the future.
These people feel that in seeking
a third term he is serapping a
tradition which has existed dur
ing our entire national history.
Many of this same group state
that Mr.. Roosevelt has been a
credit to the country and that,


under his leadership, they feel
more secure in our foreign rela-

nestle problems of greater i'm
portance and fear that the world
problems will have too much
weight in the coming election.
1t is this type of voter who will
determine the November cleo
ton. If, during the next month,
these hesitant voters go in the
Roosevelt direction it will mean
his overwhelming victory. On
the other hand, should October
develop domestic issues as of
much greater Importance than
our foreign policy, then Willkie
will likely be our next President.

MARYLAND BRIDGE


STATUTE UPHELD

Constitutional Objections to
Proposed Spans Ruled


, Invalid.",Py the Associated Press.,"Py the Associated Press.


ANNAPOLIS, Nd. Sept. 30.-Le-
gality Of the State act providing for
construction Of four bridges was upheld
yesterday by the Maryland Court Of
Appeals.


The court affirmed the decision Of
Judge Eugene O'Dunne in Baltimore,
who refused to issue an injunction
to prevent the State Roads Commits
sion from proceeding with plans to
construct the bridges across the Sus-
quehanna, Potomac and Patapsco
Rivers and the Chesapeake Bay.


The enjoining order was sought by
Clinton Wyatt, taxpayer. The
bridges, part Of $30,000,000 State
program, figured in the Democratic
primary campaign during which Pres
ident Roosevelt inspected site at
Morgantown. Representative David
J. Lewis, defeated for the Senate
nomination by Senator Millard E.
Tydings, conferred with the President
Tuesday trying to do something
which would permit their construc-
ton.


Objections Held Invalid.


The appellate court settled all con-
stitutional objections to the proposed
bridges by declaring the objections
invalid.


The principal issue, the court held,
was whether the issuance OF revenue
bond issue for the cost Of the bridges
would be unconstitutional under the
statute that DEGREES the Legislature
may not contract debt without max
retire the debt.


The revenue bonds would be paid
entirely from bridge tolls.


The court held the revenue bonds
were specifically created as self-retir-
ing and did not constitute State
debt, and that hence the objection
was unfounded.


The injunction petition also asserted
the contract of the State Highway
Commission for annual maintenance
Of the proposed bridges was uncon-
Stitutional under the same law. The
opinion said the bridges would be-
come q part of the State highway
system Immediately on completion and
maintenance would be only an ordi-
nary highway maintenance burden,
provided for in law and in no sense
an addition to the States debt.


Reading Issue Invalid


The court also held that the con-
stitutional challenge to the bridges on
the ground that the statute had not
been read three times on separate
days before both Houses of the Leg
islature was without foundation. Al
though the law was read only on the
calendar date Of April 5, the bill was
read before both Houses on separate
legislative days. This issue was so
narrow as to be invalid, the court
held, and was highly technical and
dubious


Objection on the ground that COL
lection and disbursement of the bridge
tolls was vested in the State Roads
Commission instead OF the State con-
troller's Office was also dismissed by
the court. The opinion held the reve-
nue. bond debt was no concern of the
State and that it would be misappli-
cation Of the toll revenues to place
them with the regular State revenues."

to be discouraging a move to

tion to bring about a showdown
at a meeting of the State group
Wednesday is expected to fall

MIR. Farley called the meeting to
complete slate of national con-
vention delegates with selections
representing 10 votes. The majority
OF these are likely to favor fourth
term for President Roosevelt, which
Mr.. Farley has opposed.


Twenty convention delegates. each
with half vote, will be selected at
the meeting. along with 20 alter
mates. The 10 convention votes will
be added to those of the 86 district
delegates elected in the State pri-
mary, each Of whom has a full vote.


O'ConneIl's Head Move.


One highly-placed Democrat said
he was certain no announcement
was being given by National Com

by Daniel P. O'Connell and John J.
O'Connell, jr., brothers who head the
Albany Democratic organization, to
supplant Mr.. Farley as State chair
man at the meeting with Thomas j.

The OConnells have demanded
that Mr.. Farley be replaced with a
fourth-term advocate, since the
States delegation to the national
convention will be for the President
and New York will be a battle

was interpreted as a gesture toward
unity recently by inviting National
Chairman Robert e. Hannegan and
Senate Majority Leader Barkley to
be principal speakers at the party's
annual Jefferson Club dinner in New
York City May 8.


Beyond that, friends point out that
Mr.. Farley has not lined up publicly
with any OF the anti-fourth term
movements that have been started
within the Democratic ranks. At

Secretary Of War, to get MIR. Farley

 Reorganization is nowhere more needed than in the Federal Governments diverse labor activities, That such reorganization is in the offng is indicated no less by the nomination of Judge Lewis Schwellen bach to be Secretary Labor than by the Presidents request for authority to effect general orienaton of executive agencies Judge Schwellenbach is cer- tainly not leaving lifetime seat the Federal bench to accept empty Cabinet title. His initial task clearly will be to create, effective instrument, the department which he is to preside If he does so comprehensvey, he will head of the most vital and potentially useful of Federal agencies It will administer some of the most important social and economic legislation developed under the Roosevelt Administration and it will play significant part in the trying period of reconversion from to peace.

 The Labor Department had it's inception as a service agency for workers Its primary function IS to foster the welfare of wage earners, improve their working conditions and advance their opportunities for profitable employment. This entails, among other things efforts to harmonze the relations between employers and employees surveillance over public laws governing these relations assistance in securing jobs and protection of labors rights. These activities are now divided among widely scattered agencies. The Consolidation Service within the Labor Department works at harmonizng employer employee relations; so does the National Mediation Board, for instance which has jurisdiction railway workers and is outside the Department. The Wage and Hour and Public Contracts Divisions of the Labor Department enforce specific labor laws so does the National Labor Relations Board which is altogether independ ent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does valuable endowment research inside of the Department; but the actual promotion of employment is carried on outside by the United States Employment Service.

 Judge Schwellenbach will have to begin by blend ing refining and coordinatng these activities In general all the service and regulatory functions of the Government respecting labor ought to be brought within his jurisdiction in order to avoid purposes and to centralize responsibility He will encounter

 special problem, however with respect to the quasi judicial bodies such as the NLRB, which not only enforce laws but also pass judgment upon issues ars- ing under them The judicial functions of such boards must clearly be divorced from executive control if they are to retain the respect of the public and serve as something more than political instruments They must be- in short in a position to judge the acts of the Secretary of Labor. And therefore they must be independent of him far the appointment and and tenure of their members concerned It might be feasible we should think, to place them within the Labor Department for budget and housekeeping pur poses and to have them report to the President through the Secretary but he should not be able to govern them

 No doubt Judge Schwelenbach with his experience on the bench will appreciate this distinction and will temper his reorganization plans accordingly. The latonship of the Court formerly called the Board of Tax Appeals to the Treasurys Bureau of Internal Revenue affords model. The term ""Czar"" has ironically into vogue in the war years. It is term which the new Secretary of Labor ough to eschew His authority the labor domain should be comprehensive; but it should not be absolute"

 Poll By Fortune",,"NEW YORK.-At last the anti-labOrites have a reason for wanting to get the war over in a hurry. The latest Survey of Public Opinion of Fortune magazine reveals that three quarters of American workers would support Pres.

 As a matter of fact, enough people in the higher income brackets feel the same way that the percentage of fourth termers in all groups is 64.8 as compared to 27.8 opposed and ""A undecided.

 Results of the poll are already in print and they show an amazing popular indifference to anti-ROOse- welt anguish of the Mccormick Hearst-HOover variety. And just to button the hair shirt little tighter, the editors have class-angled the figures, dividing the voters into economic groups: high, uper mid- dIe, lower middle, and low.

 ""Roosevelt's greatest show of strength"" the editors commented, continues to lie among the economic groups that have always supported him. the lower middle, the low and the Negroes.

 The answers to this series of questions led the editors to com ment: ''The American people are getting set now to take an active part in the postwar international scene. They do not mean to repeat after the present war the errors they made after the last one.

President Roosevelt arrived here to-
day for drive through Yosemite
National Park. The Chief Ex-
ecutive had sunny weather for his
sightseeing tour.

ABOARD PRESIDENT ROOSE-
VELT'S TRAIN, en- route to Yosemite,
Calf, July 15.-The Navy claimed
wide attention as a powerful national
defense weapon today under a spot
light focused by President Roosevelt.


Speaking at Treasure Island in San
Francisco Bay yesterday afternoon.
the Chief Executive declared the feet
was mot merely a SYMBOL"" but ""a
potent, ever.ready fact"" in the defense
set-up of this country.


Then a short while later, he sat on
the forward superstructure Of the
cruiser Houston while she steamed up
and down line of 60-odd men of war.


Mr.. Roosevelt made his declaration
of the Navy's potency simultaneously
with hint Of United States willing
ness to participate in arms reduction
with the nations of the world.


Expressing hope that ""other leading
nations"" would realize their present
course must inevitably lead them to
disaster"" he said:


I'VE stand ready to meet them and
encourage them in any efforts they
may make toward a definite reduction
in world armament""
After the feet review, in which every
saluting battery in the armada tired
21-gun greeting to the President,
he rested several hours aboard tho
Houston. then set out for Yosemite
National Park.


Reboarding his train at oakland
last night after a day in the San
Francisco area, Mr.. Roosevelt trav-
eled overnight to Ell Portal, gateway
to the park. He arranged q 250-mile
trip through Yosemite's famed big
tree forest.


He will travel overnight to Los
Angeles.


No Applause on Plea.


The Chief Executive, greeted In San
Francisco and its suburbs by wildly
cheering thousands, received no ap.
plause on his disarmament plea.


Distinguished Californians, includ-
ing Senators McAdoo, Democrat, and
Johnson. Republican, and Gov. Mer-
riam, cheered his words about q
powerful Navy, but did not stir when
he announced the Government was
ready to take part in an arms reduc-
ton move.


The theme of Mr.. Roosevelt's speech
delivered slowly and solemly in q
crescent hall of the 1899 San Francisco
Exposition Administration Building
was peace.


New York and San Francisco fairs
next year would do much to promote
understanding therefore, friend
liness-between the people of this and
other lands.


Favors Definite Steps.


And, in concluding, he said:


""The year 1889 would go down in
history not only as the year Of the
two great American world fairs, but
would be q year Of worldwide rejoic-
ing if it could also mark definite steps
toward permanent world peace""


Senator McAdoo, who is seeking re-
nomination for the Senate. sat to the
Presidents right as he spoke. The
Senator was the first Californian to
greet Mr.. Roosevelt when he arrived
at Crockett yesterday morning.


Senator McAdoo was waiting at the
station when the Presidents train
pulled in and soon afterward was
called aboard for conference inside
the Presidents private car. Senator
and Mrs. McAdoo were with the Chief
Executive when he reviewed the neet.


Full Navy Ceremony.


The feet spectacle took place in
hill-surrounded San Francisco Bay.
As the Houston, flying the Presidents
flag, steamed past each alert warship
the full Navy ceremony between ships
was carried through.


Bluejackets, wearing their woolen
uniforms in the cool breeze, manned
the rails at rigid attention, marine
guards came to present arms"" bugles
sounded, bands played The Star
Spangled Banner"" and the saluting
batteries created their deafening noise.


The mightiest Of the feet, battle
ships headed by the flagship, Penn
sylvania; fast cruisers, sleek destroyers
and ominous-appearing submarines
were in the ranks Of fighters drawn up
for the President to see."

E. De,oey's campaign address


here last night:


1t is mighty good to come back
again to Minnesota, the State OF
that gallant leader, Comdr. Harold
Stassen. AS a great Governor and
as bold and courageous leader of
opinion, he rendered services to his
country equaled only by his present
services in the Navy.


To the people of Minnesota he
gave something else very precious
and too long absent from our ma
tional life. He gave teamwork gov
ernment, not one-man government


AS result when he left for the
Navy there was a flrst-class man
ready and able to fill his shoes.
That man has so ably and success
fully conducted the affairs of the
State that every one agrees you will
re-elect by an overwhelming ma
jority, my good friend, Gov. Ed
ward J. Thye.


The experience of the people of
Minnesota under these great Re-
publican administrations points the
way toward the progressive, forward
looking teamwork government the
people will install in the Nation next
January 20.


Farm Program Pledge.


had intended to talk tonight
about some of the problems of the
American farmer. I have deferred
that talk so that / can, without de-
lay, correct some errors and omis-
sions in the speech of my opponent
of last Saturday night. But before
doing so. want to here and now
repledge my adherence to the farm
program of the Republican plat
form, which was drawn by the farm
leaders themselves.


The wide f1uctuation of prices of
farm products that followed the last
war will not be tolerated. A floor
will be placed and maintained under
farm prices with assurance of seal
up crop loans. A proper farm pro-
gram will be created and so operated
that it will leave with the farmers
the administration, the control and
operation of their program without
domination or dictation from ap-
pointed bureaucrats


Three Great Obiectives.


On three great objectives, we,
the American people, are wholly
agreed. We are determined to carry
through this war to swift and total
victory. We are determined that
the United States shall take the
lead. even before victory in the war
Is won, in the establishment of a
world organization to prevent future
wars. We are determined that our
fighting men shall find when they
return victorious vigorous and
productive America, the kind of
America in which there will be jobs
and opportunity for all.


1t was for the purpose Of keep
Ing our unity for peace that. last
August l, I lifted our peace plans
wholly out of partisan confticts-by
joining hands with Secretary Hull
in work on the proposed organiza-
ton to prevent future wars.


In my addresses on that subject,
] have tried to keep it out of parti-
san debate.


Unhappily, however, last Saturday
night, my opponent once again
sowed among us the seeds of dis
unity. He made long speech on
foreign affairs. We had hoped he
would speak to the American people
as groWn-ups and tell us what our
foreign policy is and where it is 60
ing.


Dreamed of Yesterday.


I'VE had also hoped to hear some
word of cheer about the smaller
nations, so important to the con-
science of the American people
some word about the fate of Poland,
some hope for the people of Italy,
some assurance that the Scandina-
Wan countries which have suffered
so much, and the other small coun-
tries. might soon be admitted to

for organized peace.

Something new and different In
the way of interior decoration has
developed from the unusual hobby
of Hartzell Lincoln Dake, IL, Of Paul
Junior High School.


Hartzell's hobby is collecting pa
triotic posters. He began shortly
after the Japanese stab in the back
last December 7 and his first poster,
appropriately enough. was one urg-
ing Americans to Remember Pearl
Harbor.""


Since then Hartzell has rounded
up so many posters that where to
keep them has become problem.
And that's where the interior dec
Grafton comes in. Hartzen has III
orally ""papered"" his bedroom with
his posters. ..


In fact, except for the ceiling and
the floor, there is scarcely an inch
of the room that Is not covered
with posters. There are all kinds
Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast
Guard, Red Cross, War bonds and
stamps and War Production Board.
After decorating the walls Hartzell
still had several posters left. Rather
than keep them rolled up out Of
sight he gave them to some Of his
friends. Putting them on the cell
ing was out of question at the tirne
because his collection of model air
planes was hanging from 1t by
strings. But the planes are down
now, so there is space for many
more posters if Hartzell wants to
use 1t.


Shortly after the picture on the
left was made Harzell was stricken
with bronchial pneumonia. He is
recovering ct this writing, however,
and The Junior Star hopes he will
soon be well enough to continue
with his collections. In the mean
time his parents are doing their
best to keep it up to date.


X X X X


Last year, when Hartzell was a
pupil at Brightwood School, his
planes won several prizes.


Next to planes and posters his
favorite pastime is listening to the
various quiz programs on the radio.
He does his listening with a re-
ceiving set worth $75 which he won
last February with a question he
submitted to the ""Quiz Kids"" At
the time his illness developed he
was working on a series of questions
for Information, Please"" He hopes
to win an expensive encyclopedia.
Now that he is in the seventh grade
he feels it's about time he grad
uated from the old one-volume en-
cyclopedia he has been using.
Despite the war, American boys
and girls have much to be thankful
for this Thanksgiving. In contrast
to the young people of most of the
other countries involved in the war,
they are very we'll off, indeed.


The children of the lands occu-
pied by the Germans and the Jap
anese are enslaved, along with their
parents. Russias girls and boys
live in constant danger of death,
and life in Great Britain is little,
if any, safer. Everywhere there is
danger, hardship, even privation.


Everywhere, that is, except in the
United States. Here there is still
plenty of everything needed for rea-
sonable comfort and safety. We
have Wholesome food and good cloth
ing; our schools are still carrying
on; we remain free to do pretty
much as we please.


President Roosevelt has pro-
claimed Thanksgiving a day of
prayer. Boys and girls, as we'll as
men and women, will, of course,
pray for the continuing success of
our fighting forces. But they should
not forget to pray, too, in thanks
giving for the many blessings that
are ours.

It Is a simple fact that Canada and the United States would not feel safe if German air base were to be set up in southern Greenland. It is less than thousand miles to the North Amer ican seaboard form that point - just a hop-skip- and jump for modern long range bomber.

 Experience of the past two years has amply proved that the only way to assure safety in these matters is to move first. The British hesitated to violate the neu- trality of Belgium and Holland and Scan- dinavia. And while they tesitared, medi- ating on niceties of international law, the Nazis acted. Seizing the initiative in the mostest."" And they won.

 President Roosevelt would seem to have learned the lesson. Germany might well want Greenland because of Its value as a base to attack British shipping, as weather observation station, as a source of cryolite. Her planes have scared over it. The President obviously determined that this time the Germans should not be first. Greenland, almost all of 1t, IS clearly in the Western Hemisphere. It's occupation by Germany would be dan- ger to the United States. We act, there fore, in our own interest, determined for once to ""be there first"" Denmark need not worry about permanent seizure of the island. The United States does not want 1t. Whenever free Denmark is in posi- ton to govern Greenland again, unmen- aced by force, the United States will re- store it.

 Europe and all the lands in it may be merely set of prizes to be raked in by the strongest, like chips in poker game are not prizes to be fought over in this way. The United States so determined 118 years ago. The American republics, all of them, are like-minded today. This we have said and we meant what we said."

The attorney asserted Hines had
asked him to take an income tax
case for Arthur Dutch Schultz
Flegenheimer, slain policy racket
eer, but that he refused.


From a Lower East Side tailor
shop, where he worked as ''bast-
ing boy"" the little immigrant boy
put himself through two years at the
City College of New York and in
1893 was graduated from Colum-
bia Law School with honors and
$50 prize money.


BY contrast, three decades later
his fees were staggering. One client
was said to have paid him $500
minute for the time he spent In
court arguing an appeal.


In Many Spectacular Cases.


Mr.. Steuer was attorney in many
spectacular cases, among them the
litigation that grew out of the Tri-
angle shirtwaist factory fire, which
took 145 lives in 1911. Among his
clients we're Max boo Hoo Hoff,
Philadelphia underworld king, and
Bridge Webber, one of the muir
derers of Herman Rosenthal.


He estimated he won 95 per cent of
his $500 cases from 1893 to 1908, but
said he was too busy to keep account
of his average after that.


Once Mr.. Steuer tangled with
Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Gov
ernor of New York, in Mr.. Steuer's
famous investigation into the Bank
of United States failure. Mr.. Roose-
velt took the stand in behalf Of his
superintendent of banks, Joseph A.
Broderick, accused of neglect OF
duty.


Angry because the Governor had
been brought into the case, Mr..
Steuer protested vigorously, accusing
Mr.. Roosevelt of making speeches""
instead of answering questions. Mr..
Broderick was acquitted."

ELLIOTT ROOSEVELT",,"1t is bit hard to understand why
there is so much furore about the cap
tan's commission bestowed upon Presi-
dent Roosevelt's son, Elliott


II is hard to understand because an
other son of the President, James, has
a similar commission, and got very little
publicity out of it. Yet of the two,
James is the one who has been, a faith
full son, politically. Elliott has disagreed
with his father more than once.


Of course Elliott had no previous mill
tary training, and of course the award
of the captaincy eXempts him from the
draft, but then neither did James have
any previous military training or eX-
perience, and he too is exempted from
the draft.


The third son of the President, Frank
lin ir., is the only one who is entitled
to a commission. He has undergone an
ROTC course and is entitled to a reserve
officers commission as a lieutenant.


1t is extremely unfortunate that none
of the three sons of President Roosevelt
should be subject to the draft, although
all are of draft age We cannot believe
that the President, or even Mrs. Roose-
welt, would Intentionally seek to obtain
commissions for them in order that they
might not have to serve as privates in
the conscriptiOn army alongside mil
lion other young men. We would rather
believe that some over-ambitiouS person
in the war department sought to curry
favor at the White House by making the
commissions possible to the Presidents
two unqualified sons.


We cannot conceive Of Mrs. Roosevelt
approving such an action, because she has
been the most active woman in the nation
in urging young men to meet the neces-
sites of national defense bravely and in
the spirit of sacrifice that is needed to
surmount a national emergency.


We cannot conceive of President Roose-
welt approving such an action because
we believe he should realize his duty to
set an example for other Americans to
follow


Since, through some unfortunate error,
both Elliott and James have received ar
my commissions to which they are not
entitled, we believe the President would
be justified in asking them to resign
their captaincies and place themselves
subject to the draft that will begin Oct

diplomatic mission, headed by Ambas-
sador Robert Murphy, has been detailed
to assist Gen. Eisenhower in Germany.


But Gen. Macarthur is reported to
have stressed that such diplomatic
mission must remain completely under
his control. Gen. Macarthur has made
long study of the Far East and has
some very definite ideas about the future
OF Japan. 1t was he who last winter
suggested that the only faetual modifi-

terms should be the maintenance of the
dynasty.


The general is convinced that with
people who have the psychology of the

Emperor-deity in order to facilitate the
task of the American forces of occupa-

Gen. Macarthur believed early in the
year that if the Allies would issue a
statement that the Emperor would be
maintained, the Japanese would sur
render without too long a delay-prob-
ably before the surrender of the Ger
mans.


Whether previous reports along this
line were taken up at Yalta by Presi-
dent Roosevelt is not definitely known.
But from the bits Of information that
have permeated the veil of secrecy that
shrouded the conference, it appears that
Premier Stain was even more suspicious
of the japanese than he was of the
Germans and felt that the time was
not yet ripe for any deals"" with Japan.


1t was only at Potsdam, when Presi-
dent Truman informed his Allied COL
leagues that America was determined
to permit the dynasty to remain on the
throne in Japan provided that the other
terms of unconditional surrender were
accepted, that Premier Stain raised no
objections. Moreover, the war against
objections.


Gen. Macarthur will be in complete
control in Japan. politically and mill
tarily. He intends to run his own show
and has definite ideas about how to
handle the situation. His short-range
policy is said to be characterized by
""toughness."" His long range policy is
to make Japan-if the japanese show
definite signs of having had enough of
conquests and wars-into a worthy ma
ton with which we will be able to CO.

Unionism had settled down to main
tanning its ne strike pledge until the
miners struck. Since that frightful and
dangerous disregard of legally estab-

most extensive outbreaking of strikes
since Pearl Harbor.


This turmoil may be the result of two
things Firstly, it may indicate the be
lief of labor as a whole that the little
steel formula is insufficient to balance
the increase in prices and costs. If so,
then Mr.. Roosevelt should bring indivl-
dual income and out-go into better bal

On the other hand, the strikes may or
iginate as the result of Mr.. Lewis bad
example It is natural that if one power
group defies the law as did the miners,
others should follow suit.


Had the strikes been prior to Mr. Lewis
unpatriotic act, then the cause could be
assumed to be universal unfairness III

asmuch as the strikes all followed
AFTER Lewis rebellion, they can be as
sumed to result from the me, too mo-

All of which forces the conclusions

that Allied naval units suffered
heavy damage in Thursdays two
bombing attacks on the north coast
port, attacks which constituted the
first assaults on the Australian
mainland since it became part of
the British Empire.

attacks on Darwin bore the SwaStika

Drawings and water colors oi
naval defense activity by Vernon
Howe Bailey, made under the au-
thorization Of the Navy Depart
ment, are now on view as spe-
cial exhibition in the Corcoran Gal
lery of Art, where they may be
seen until February 10. These in
clude battleships. aircraft carriers
submarines. cruisers and a few Brit
ish men of war-65 in all-done
practically within the last six
months under Government COM
mission.


Vernon Howe Bailey is one of the
best-known illustrators in this coun-
try with a very distinguished career
In 1917. upon this country's entrance
into the World War, he was the
first artist authorized by the Gov
ernment to picture Americas wal
work in navy yards, gunshops
munitions plants and with the fleet
The collection of the drawings ther
made was exhibited in art museums
throughout the country and later
acquired by the Smithsonian 1nsti-
tuition. A set of these prints was
installed also in the French Wal
Museum III Paris. He Is represented
in the Hispanic Museum in New
York by a collection of drawings
made in Spain in 1921 and 1925.


An exhibition of his ""Skyscrap-
ers Of New York"" was exhibited
not only in this country, but in
London and Madrid. In the latter
city the exhibition was opened Of
ficially by King Alfonso XIII. He
has also the distinction Of having
been permitted to make a series
OF drawings and water colors OF
the Vatican Palace, including the
private apartments of the Pope.


He has served as staff artist on
the Philadelphia Times, the Boston
Herald, the New York Herald, the
Times. the Journal and the Sun.
and has worked for Harpers Maya
zine, Scribners, Century and many
.others.


Obviously Mr.. Bailey is first and
last an illustrator-and one OF the
best. His war-work drawings wit
ness to facts-and very big facts
at that. They tell what this coun-
try has been doing in the last year
to prepare us for war and safe
guard our Nation-a record which
,arouses pride and tends to increased
confidence.


At times in these illustrative
drawings and paintings-a few be-
ing in wash-he rises to a very
distinct height purely from the
standpoint of art-as, for example
In his striking rendition of ~. S. 8
Aircraft Carrier Hornet"" as seen in
the Norfolk Navy Yard, tied up al
the wharf and looming large against
the sky. 1t is in instances such as
this that art while subservient to
illustration plays a very large part
in conveying the desired message.


At the last moment two additional
works were placed in this notable
exhibition, both of H. M. S. Duke
of York, a magnificent battleship
ON board of which Churchill and
his associates were brought to this
country for conference. These
drawings. beautifully made, also
had dignity and distinction.


Vernon Howe Bailey comes OF
New England stock, his ancestors
having settled in Massachusetts, as
early as 1910. He studied art first
in Philadelphia, at the academy"

 The best bet seems to be to use women to ferry training ships and other light craft. Or to enlist them as ground school instructors and co-pilots. Possibly, with a large per cent of the commercial airplane pilots in the Air Corps Reserve, there may be need for women in that field long open only to men.

 Many women pilots are surpris- ed to find the army breaking down and bothering about them Last year when the question came up in congressional commit tee hearings, only Admiral Tow CTS gave the girls any encourage ment, testifying he could use them to fly training planes.

BEST ON RECORD


Dauber's favorable position 4a
hours before Maryland's richest
race is run is attributable to
many elements


In the first place Marylanders
can't forget the great race the
William dupont colt ran at the
recent Havre de Grace meet.


In the second place Dauber is
conceded the best chance because
he finished second to Lawrin in
the Derby last Saturday and far
ahead of any other Derby horse
entered in the Preakness.
Lastly, Dauber has been working
splendidly for the Preakness, turn,
ing a mile and quarter, which
is a sixteenth more than the
PreakneSS route, yesterday in
2:09 3-5, merely breezing.


Strangely enough, you don't
hear the name of Fighting Fox
very much around the Pimlico
course, as you did a week ago at
Churchill Downs. This, despite
the fact the Fox is a Belair Stud
entry and true Marylander, for
the Belair Stud is located near
Washington on the Defense High
way.


Fighting Fox took a workout on
the firm Pimlico track yesterday,
but no figures were announced
as to his time. Possibly it wasn't
good enough to merit announce
ment, or possibly it was so good
they wished to keep it a secret.


PREPARE FOR CROWD


Bull Lea worked in a manner
which satisfied his trainer, Frank
Kearns, who kept the colt under
wraps after the first half mile
and Can't Wait was out on the
track but worked slowly, having
been pronounced ready several
days ago and needing only to be
kept on edge.


Meanwhile Vice President AL

''' 'llInR .,a'; u!!.",,"The rapidly moving events of the
past week. together with the lack of
complete reports for security reasons,
make it extremely difficult to assess
the situation from the sidelines.


On the Eastern front in Europe
The diminishing distance between the
Red Army and Berlin has held our
daily attention While we are apt to
assume that the distance to Berlin
is synonymous with the distance to
the end of the war in Europe, this
Is not necessarily so.


In the wars of Frederick the Great,
nearly two hundred years ago, Berlin
was twice occupied within the space
of three years, once by an Austrian
army and once by Russian army.
Frederick, in the end, came out on
top.


That the Nazis are leaving Berlin
and establishing headquarters in
Munich has been reported during
the week. The destruction of the
German armies, and the seizure of
her means of production may better
be the key to the end of the war. To
this end, much has been accom-
pliShed.


Moscow has announced staggering
figures of German losses. German
SileSia, an important industrial area,
is now in control of Soviet forces.
The Allies in the west, with forrnid-
able defenses to break through, may
soon reach the Rullr valley. Con-
quest of this region would conceiv-
ably break the back of the German
war production machine.


Nevertheless, continued opposition
must be looked for. The desperate
and fanatical Nazis are probably
ready to carry their country and
their people to ruin with them, and
with the secret police and inner
party thugs, may prolong the strug-
gle for some months.


Additional forces to aid in the de-
struction of the Nazis will be sup
piled by the French. The French
War Ministry has declared that
France will have an army of / 200, 600
men equipped and ready to fling at
the Germans by the end of spring.
This contribution on the part of
France to the Allied war effort is
the direct result of conversations
held recently among Prime Minister
Churchill, Gen. Eisenhower and Gen
De Gaulle, in which the Allies agreed
to supply the French forces with
more arms, the Ministry said
France, poverty stricken and indus
shattered as the result of
German occupation, has been unable
to raise and equip her army unaided


In the Pacific we continue to make
progress. The Battle of Lllzon has
remained in our favor, with enor-
NOUS casualties inflicted on the
enemy. The appointmentof 1t. Gen.
Joseph Stilwell to head the AGF
may point to early increased atten-
ton in that theatre. Gen. Stilwells
wealth of knowledge of the Jap and
the terrain upon which the battles
will have to be fought will be invalu-
able to our forces. At a news con-
ference this week in Washington

This manner of using the slogan
planned economy"" is very adroit
manipulation of words and ideas.
OF COURSE, it deceives no one


who knows what the collectivists
want.


The collectivists want ""the gov
ernment"" to ""plan"" everything
the production Of all the farms and
factories; the distribution of every
article; the job of every worker, in
cluding his work hours and his
wages; the food rations of every per-
son, the garments of every citizen,
the dwelling places of every family,
and even the pastimes of every child.


Much more is involved to make
the ""plan"" successful.


Under the planned economy"" of
the collectivists ""the government""
would monopolize the press and the
radio, telling the entire population
what to believe and what to think.


Furthermore, there would have to
be oppressive regulation of the
people under bureaucratic regula-
tion, with no appeals to independent
courts of justice, for ""the govern
ment"" would have to compel every
body either to obey its DEGREES or
else be fined $4,000 or be sent to
prison for 10 years.


AS ""planned economy"" worked
out in Fascist Italy, in Nazi Germany
and in Communist Russia, free
speech became crime instead of a
democratic right, and that is unques-
tionably the way it would work out
here.


Finally, as Winston Churchill
says, under such conditions there
would have to be a ""gestapo"" to
watch over the regimented populace,
and this would not improbably re-
quire concentration camps-though
perhaps under the name Of planned
detention parks.


The easy sounding slogan
planned economy"" implies all this.


PLANNED ECONOMY"" means
SOCIALIST ECONOMY"" and can.
not ever mean anything else.


And that is why the collectivists
artfully SAY planned economy""
instead of honestly SAYING 80.
cialist economy"" ""enslaved citi-
zenry"" and ""despotic government. 1""


What would become Of the
pseudo logic of the collectivists if we
had pure language law, like the
pure foods and drugs act, requiring
them to use truthful words instead
of decoy words and false phrases and

Full Membership in


Advisory Commission


Granted by Big 8",BY JOSEPH H. BAIRD.,"The United States, Great Brit
ain and Russia have invited
France to assume full member
ship on the European Advisory
Commission, which will decide
the treatment to be accorded
Germany after the defeat of
that nation, the State Depart
ment announced today.


This is the most advanced step
yet taken toward reconstituting
France as a great power.


The invitation was extended to
the French Provisional Govern
ment at Paris. where Prime Minis.
ter Churchill is making an Armis-
tice Day visit. The action was an
nounced jointly here and in London
and Moscow


Diplomatic observers interpreted
the move to mean that the govern
ment of Gen. Charles de Gaulle
now will be welcomed into the con-
cert of big powers which will deal
with Germany after the war and
also will become the nucleus of the
postwar security organization.


Recognized on October %.


Less than a month ago. October
%, the United States and Britain
recognized the administration of
Gen. De Gaulle as a full fledged
provisional government.


Jefferson Caffery, one of the top
flight United States diplomats, was
named Ambassador to Paris.


At the same time Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Allied commander on
the western front, turned back to
french administration virtually all
OF France except those northeastern
border areas actually in combat.


Gen. de Gaulle insisted at the
time that recognition was not
enough-that France must be given
a full share in deciding future
European policies. His primary re-
quest was for membership on the
European Advisory Commission.


Gen. de Gaulle had refused to
join in making decisions on Ger
man control policy so long as Frances
part was limited to suggestions and
advice and she was barred from the
commissions discussions.
The United States, Britain and
Russia sometime ago projected a
great power role for France in the
/ future by agreeing that in due
course"" that nation should be one
OF the five permanent members of
the World Council proposed in the
Dumbarton Oaks security plan along
with the present big three and
China. 1t is expected that France
will be invited soon to place in the
council.

how the British manage to retain their free institutions
when they hear that the House of Commons has voted
itself another year of existence.


The present Parliament is in its eighth ,year, being
the longest since 1879. 1t has witnessed Ne kings,
three prime ministers, royal jubilee, royal abdica-
ton the outbreak of the present and the destruc
ton of its Chamber by enemy action.


The British Parliament of course, possesses unim-
tied power 1t is restricted to written constitution
and upon all occasions acts in accordance with its best
Judgment for the protection of the interests entrusted
to it's care.


There is no Supreme Court in Great Britain with
the power to nulify act of Parliament Whatever
she law may be- passed by Parliament everybody else
in the Island must obey the statute.


The Prime Minister and his associates hold office
as long as they command the support of Parliament
subject to the provision that except in abnormal times
general election cannot be postponed longer than five
years.


There is not person in the United Kingdom today
under twenty-eight years of age who has voted in
general election but everybody agrees that this not
desirable and that the Churchill Government will remain
in power until the end of the war."

The British, however, are In Q more

the manner in which political problems
were being handled by the government.

ton""


Mr.. Martin told reporters Mr.. Hull
discussed with us his ideas of how
to implement the peace, along the
same lines he had talked with BIZ
partisan Senate group""


The conference with the House
group follows a series of five meet
ings between Mr.. Hull and an eight
man Senate committee. The Senate
has responsibility for passing on
treaties and the House is not con-
stitutionally charged with power
over foreign affairs, although Mr..
Bloom has proposed action to make
treaty ratification subject to a ma
jority vote of each house.


Mr.. Hull's decision TO meet with
House, as well as Senate members
of both parties, has been interpreted
at the State Department as repre-
senting a desire on his part to OBJ
tain the widest possible support for
his plans.


After the Senate talks, Mr.. Hull
invited Britain, Russia and China
to send representatives here for ex-
ploratory conversations on postwar
world organization. Yesterday at
press conference he was asked
whether he could reassure small ma
tions that they would be protected
from domination by the great pow
ers. He said there should be no
doubt of Americas attitude on that
score and also gave assurances of
American support and encourage
ment for the liberty of all peoples
everywhere.


In some respects his concentra-
ton on this ideal seemed opposed to
the remark of Prime Minister
Churchill in Parliament a week ago
that the war is growing LESS ideo-
logical in character""


Further, Secretary Hull stated that
1t is United States policy to en-
courage ""all nations to aspire to
liberty"" whereas Mr.. Churchill told
Parliament he opposes the idea Of
interfering with governments just
because their administration does
not come up to our ideas""


If Mr.. Hull intended his remarks,
voiced at a news conference yester-
day. to draw a distinction between
his feelings and Mr.. Churchill's ap-
praisal, he apparently would take
his place alongside President Roose-
velt in seeming to differ with the
line the British Prime Minister had
followed.


Although not commenting directly
on Mr.. Churchill's speech, the Pres
ident said at a news conference
Tuesday that in his mind Spain has
not cut down sufficiently on her
trade with the Axis, while Mr..
Churchill emphasized in his talk
what Spain already had done to
help the Allied cause.


Mr.. Hull's statements covered two
main points:


!. He reaffirmed the intention of
this Government Ito see that all
nations. especially the small nations,
are kept on a position of equality
with all others and that, in every
practicable way, there will be CO.
operation""


2. He then hammered especially
hard the point that the United
States has long record of cham
pionship of liberty for everybody, en-
couraging them at all times and in
Ill places"""

likely to whip Stir Up, there was a /

foot forward in book written by its
first Minister to the United States
Walter Nash, and published recently by
Duell, Sloan & Pearce. New Zealand
a Working Democracy"" tells a story OF
absorbing interest, and tells it with the
authority of one who has had large
hand in shaping the conditions about
which he writes.


Walter NaSh-who had been, Incl
dentally first manufacturer and then
wholesale merchant-Was the president
of the national Labor party when 1t
came into power in 1885, and at the time
of his appointment to Washington he
held four or five separate cabinet posts,
including that of Minister of Finance
During the absence of the Prime Minis
ter, Peter Fraser, from New Zealand in
l941, he had been the head of the coun-
try. Under special legislation, he retains
while in Washington his status as a
member Of Parliament and Minister of
the Crown.


Far Beyond New Deal.


Eric Estorick, the biographer of Sir
Mr.. Nash's book that the Minister'S
''philosophic inspiration appears to be
derived from the idealism of William
Morris rather than from the economic
materialism of Karl Marx. Social re-
form, rather than social revolution, Is
his credo."" This characterization of Mr..
Nash fits accurately the results which
he has helped to bring about in
New Zealand; there has been no reyolu-
ton in the Russian sense, no abrogation
OF the private-property principle. but a
gradual enlargement Of state enterprise
to point far beyond the venturings of
+ the New Deal in this country.


What has been the effect on the well
fare OF the individual? All the benefits
he has received. say the critics, have
really been paid for by the citizen at a
fancy price"" There is high per capita
national debt; industry has been
""harassed.' For the laws of supply and
demand and the survival of the f1ttest,
there has been substituted ""an economy
which seems to differ from complete
socialism only in the retention of the
private ownership of property""
The quotations are from writer in
the Saturday Evening Post in reply to
experiment. They represent the classic
objections to governmental invasion OF
fields once sacred to private business.


Nash replies: THE planned and reg
ulated development of the Dominion s
resources that has taken place through
out her brief but crowded history has
enable the mass of the people to enjoy
today the freedom that comes with a
standard of living which compares more
than favorably with that enjoyed by the
people of any other country""


Winston Churchill, an economic con-
servative, has said: IF we can make
state enterprise and free enterprise both
serve national interests and pull the ma
tional wagon side by side, then there is
no need for us to run into that horrible,
devastating slump or into that squalid
epoch of pickering and confusion which
Knocked and squandered the hard-won
victory which we gained quarter of a
century ago.""


Tremendous War Effort.


New Zealand's mingled economy Of
state and free enterprise, whatever else
1t has done or failed to do, has produced
war effort unexcelled by any of the
United Nations. From it's population of
100000, or about the same as that
claimed by Detroit or Los Angeles, living
in an area about the size of Colorado,
New Zealand has put under arms force
relatively as large as would be an Amer
ican army, navy and home guard of
1900 900. 1t has conscription both for
home and overseas service.


The cherished 40-hour week-though
all other social reforms have been
jealousy guarded-has gone by the
board for the duration OF the war. Over
time. is now payable only after 48 hours.
The country's whole war record, on the
fighting fronts and at home, squares
with its previous demands for stronger"

Reserve Shelters
In Use; Children
Being Evacuated",BY the Associated Press.,"LONDON, July 6.-German ro-
bot bombs. concentrated on
London, have killed 2,752 per-
sons and sent 5000 to hospitals
in the last three weeks, Prime
Minister Churchill disclosed to-
day.


In addition to the 5000 hospital
tzed, Mr.. Churchill said. many others
went home after receiving first-aid
treatment.


More than 10000 of the casualties
were in London.


London is evacuating children, as
In 1910. The worlds largest city
put into use its shelters held in re-
serve for emergencies. An unstated
number of American soldiers have
been killed. Schools, hospitals and
churches were among the buildings
hit by the robots, which carry 1900
pounds of explosives


The assault continued last night
and today, damaging, among other
buildings, three hospitals in South
ern England and killing at least
half a dozen patients and nurses.


100 to $50 Robots Daily.


Mr.. Churchill told the House of
Commons that 2,754 Of the robots
had been discharged on England
in three weeks. at the rate of 100
to $50 day. but many of them had
failed to reach the island or had
been destroyed.


AS to what the Allies are going to
do about it, the Prime Minister
promised:


Everything in human power, and
we have never failed yet.


London will never be conquered,
will never fail; her renown, tri-
umphing over every ordeal, will long
shine among men.


Here we began the war and here
We will see it ended""


AS Mr.. Churchill spoke, American
heavy bombers struck anew at some
of the robots takeoff sites, sub
jected already to bombardment of
about $4,000 tons of explosives. The
RAF had hit the Pas s-de Calais area
again last night.


Various Methods Used.


Mr.. Churchill called it a very re-
narkable fact"" that a very large
proportion"" of the 2,750 bombs dis
charged from the French coast up
to last midnight ""either failed to
cross the Channel or have been shot
down and destroyed by various
methods


These methods, he said, included
""a great deployment of batteries,
aircraft and balloons which have
been very rapidly placed""


The Prime Minister disclosed that
q special committee with ""a great
number of scientists and engineers
at its disposal had been set up to
advise on offensive and defensive
methods. The committee reports to
Mr.. Churchill personally.


The flying bombs have killed more
Brltons in Southern England than
were killed in the first Is days of the
battle Of Normandy. Mr.. Churchill
said. Although he announced that
London was on blitz basis. with
casualty lists to be announced
monthly, Mr.. Churchill emphasized
that military operations in France
came first.


L do not want there to be any
misunderstanding about it,"" he said
1--WE shall not allow the battle OPP
erations in Normandy or the at
tacks We are making against special
targets in Germany to suffer""


Opposes Secret Discussion.


Mr. Churchill rejected a request
for secret discussion, saying he
thought that would give an impress
sion he had mot been frank""


Deep shelters hitherto regarded
as a reserve now will be brought
into use, Mr.. Churchill said, adding
that Home Secretary Herbert Nor
rison ought to be congratulated ION
having these up his sleeve


The total of deaths that Mr..
Churchill reported would figure at
the rate of more than $500 monthly
not so heavy as those inflicted by
the Luftwaffe at it's prime four
years ago.


Monthly casualties during the
bhtz included: September, 1910,
6.976 deaths; October, 6,311; No.
vember, 5,O03; December. 1892
January, 1941, 1,648: February, $50;
March, 4,610; April, 6,469; May,
s,601; June, 406


In disclosing that children already
are being sent from the capital, the
Prime Minister said the evacuation
of other non- essential civilians is
not being discouraged since we do
not want more people in London
than are required for business and
the purpose of peace and war""


Flying Power Diverted.


Concerning the Allied attacks on
flying bomb and rocket targets in
France and Germany, Churchill
said:


Quite a considerable proportion
of our flying power has been di-
verted from other forms of offensive
activity. The Germans have sacri-
feed a good deal of manufacturing
strength which could have increased
their fighter and bomber forces 80


1T is yet to be decided whose
effort will suffer most in the
process""


Mr.. Churchill said he could give
mo guarantee"" about the future of
this form of Germany's attack.


He recalled that when he visited
the scene of flying bomb damage
last Saturday the only question
asked of him concerned what anti
robot steps would be taken.


He said that casualty and first
aid services in Greater London were
working excellently. They are not
at all strained beyond their ca
pacity.""

the largest possible measure of unity

The formal announcements that
the negotiations had broken down
came exactly one month after Prime
Minister Winston Churchill told the
House of Commons that the British
war cabinet had agreed on a plan
for India and that Sir Stafford,
member of the cabinet and friend of
India's millions, would go to India.


The British plan originally pro-
vided for dominion status after the
war, but stipulated that India's de-
fense now must remain in British
hands. When the All-India Con-
gress objected, the British offered as
q concession to create an Indian
defense minister, with the British
commander in chief in India to re-
tain complete control in strategic
and operational spheres.


Concession Criticized.


The British were said to be willing
to transfer to the Indian defense

Sir Stafford was reported to have
said that Indian representatives on
the Viceroy's Council were offered
the following portforlios: Home,
communications, finance, including
war finance; supply, information,
broadcasting, civil defense, legisla-
tive, labor and defense departments,

New Hope Of Saving Egypt


Arises As British Stem
RommePs Drive In Desert","BY KIRKE L. SIMPSON
Wide World War Analyst","British success in stemming the
Axis drive in Egypt, momentarily
at least, and throwing Rommels
legions back for the first time since
they lurched across the Libyan-
Egyptian border aroused surge of
hope in London and WASHINGTON
that the backbone of the attack
had been broken.


If that proved true, the corridor
between the Mediterranean and the
Qattara depression could become
an Axis death trap instead of a
field of victory. There was no indi-
cation, however that the decisive
moment in the struggle had been
reached. Rommel is too we'll prov
en- warrior, too dangerous foe.
man to justify any belief that the
has spent his force and now must
run for it.


General Auchinleck has everv
reason to respect RommeTs capac-
ity for swift decisions and prompt
execution of surprise moves. The
British commander, now in person.
al direction at the front, has been
schooled by bitter experience.


Nevertheless, British success in
halting and outflanking the attack
on Ell Alamein to compel even
slight withdrawal by the foe is
highly encouraging. It probably
means that British reinforcements
tragic battle in Libya of June 13
have arrived; and that to some
extent British tank losses in that
have now been replaced.


However, if Rommel fell back
under the British thanking threat
only to reorganize, refuel and
strike again, it means only that
the first skirmish of the battle of
Alexandria terminated il British
favor. If he fell back, too exhaust.
ed or short of ammunition and SUD.
plies to strike again immediate.
and Auchinleck saw and seized his
opportunity to take the offensive.
quite a different situation would
be presented and one filled with
glittering possibilities for the Brit
ish.


Hours should serve to reveal the
true pattern of the battle IN the
Egyptian corridor. With British
and American planes battering at
his supply lines, it is obvious that
Rommel has boldly attempted to
break through to Alexandria vi
tually carrying his supplies on his
own back. He can have no assu-
ance of prompt deliveries from the
rear. His force of tanks, trucks and
men must be very largely self CO.
tanned for fuel, food, water and
ammunition. Some supplies could
reach him by air but hardly enough
for so large force.


That is the great British hope Of
turning a gruelling and still all bu,
unexplained defeat by inferior
forces into a smashing victory.
perhaps wrenching all North Afri-
ca from the Axis grip in due
course. 1t is the very grave danger
in which Rommel stands in the
Egyptian corridor which offers him
little or no opportunity to exercise
his genius for surprise turning
thrusts.


n Libya, however, he seemed in
almost as great peril prior to June
13. He had broken through the Brit
ish mine field defenses on a mar
row front. 1t is logical to assume
that the British commander and
his Eighth Army staff thought they
saw an opportunity to crush him
finally when they threw their 300
heavy tanks into an annihiliatioa
attempt that ended in British dis
aster.


The British lost 230 tank units in
that action, according to Prime
Minister Churchill's ACCOUNTING
That sealed the fate of the Eighth
Army and of Tobruk as it proved
1t came within an ace of sealing
the doom of Alexandria as well
and that threat is still grim and
ominous. 3"

 The first formal announcement of the record breaking raid came in 6 brief authoritative statement:

 Hamburg and Bremen were heavily attacked last night when the bomber command sent a record number of aircraft to Germany. :. Subsidiary attacks also were made on Berlin, Einden and several other tragets.""

 It was understood that the Royal Air Force used nearly twice as many bombing planes as it had ever used before, in It's smashing attack on some of the most important targets in Germany.

 Tn the previous record raid, several weeks ago, Its was understood that between 160 and 200 planes bombed Hamburg.

 Tn striking hardest at Hamburg and Bremen, easily the most heav- fly bombed cities of Germany, the raid was linked with the vital battle of the Atlantic.

 Last nights attack was the 0sth on Hamburg and the 65th on Brem- on.

 Tn It's first detailed communique on the British raids, the air ministry said:

 Hamburg and Bremen last night bore the brunt of the heaviest attack yet made by the Royal Air Force on Germany. The weather was good and our bombers pressed home the attack with decided results despite strong opposition.

 High explosive bombs caused widespread destruction and many great fires were seen raging in ship. yards and industrial quarters in both cities.

NEWS REVIEW

Continued from Page u",,"CONTINUED from Page ~


The three Scandinavian nations con-
tinue to feel that neutrality is their
best safeguard, and although popular
sentiment overwhelmingly is with the
British and the French, there is such
thing as jeopardizing your existence
by abandoning policy always found
sound and strong.


Not Official.


One reason why the Scandinavian
and other small neutrals were not so
terribly worried about the Churchill
effusion was the fact that the Speech
was delivered not in behalf of the
government of which he is men,
ber, but on his own personal respon-
sibility. The government even found
it necessary Monday of this week to
hint that Mr.. Churchill spoke in be-
half of himself; it did not say that
| it disapproved of the burden of his
speech, but simply that it was his,
not that of His Britannia Majesty's
government.


NO flcOSc.


Last week when a crisis between
Soviet Russia and the Scandinavian
states was threatening to become
acute, cautious announcement was
made in London and Paris to the
effect that in case of an attack on
the Northern nations, they were likely
to be aided by Britain and France.
Almost Immediately word came
from London and Paris that no such
pledge had been given, none had
been offered, none was contemplated.
However, should an act of aggres-
sion be committed against the three
nations, Great Britain and France
might out of regard for their own
particular interests do something
about it. But even that is uncertain
when one remembers what hap
pened to Anglo-French pledges given
to Czechoslovakia and Poland.
Finnish Defense.


Despite terrific winter temperatures
the Finnish defense against Russia
goes on, and so do the Russian at
tacks on Finland. Fierce fighting
appears to be in progress in the north
ern part of central Finland where the
Russians few days ago had pene-
trated about IS miles into the vicin-
ity of the so-called Salla front in a
new effort to cut Finland in two.
Desperate Finnish counter attacks
would appear to have driven the
enemy more than 80 miles back to-
ward his own border, but details are
| hazy, war bulletins-from either side
to be read with reservation, so a
clear picture of the situation is not
available. The general impression,
however, is that the Firms are hold
ing their own.


There have been hundreds of Rus
sian bombardments from the air of
Finnish cities, but, considering the
alleged fact that the invaders have
dropped nearly $4,000 bombs within
the last eight or nine days, casualties
and destruction have been, relatively
insignificant.


AS these lines are being written,
word comes of violent fighting at the
Mannerheim line on the Karelian
isthmus; it seems that the Russians
are making desperate attempt to
go through, but there has been no
report that they actually have sue
ceeded.


Quiet.


In that almost forgotten war be-
tween Germany and France, all is
still quiet along the Siegfried and
the Maginot lines; the bulletins from
both the German and the French
headquarters announce with un-
changing monotony that nothing hap
pens-right now because of the fierce
winter weather which appears to have
paralyzed all military action. But
there hasn't, for that matter, been
much activity at any time.


On the high seas it is different
ship after ship continues to go down
hit by torpedo or mine, and most OF
the victims are British, although neu-
trail vessels, as usual, have to pay
their heavy part OF the toll.


Most recently reported are the
British destroyer, ""Grenville,"" and
the following British merchant YES
sells: ""Caroni River"" ""Protesilaus,
Ferry Hill,"" ""Cairnross,"" and ""Gra-
a,""-some of them ships of con-
siderable size. Other ships downed
during the last few days are the
Danish ""Olga"" and ""Hekla,"" the lat
ter with a loss of nine lives; the
Norwegian ""Fagerheim"" and Enid
the Swedish ""Pajala"" and ''Flandria,
the German august Thyssen,"" the
Estonian ""Nautic,"" the Greek ""Aster-
ia,"" and the Belgian Josephine Char
lotte.""


No Peace Prospects,.


In spite of many and varied rumors
about a peace movement being or
foot, it now seems that there is nc
immediate prospect of ending the war
Even Pope Plus who had been some
what hopeful, appears to have come
to the conclusion that the difficultie:

But 1t Is not generally known that the British still think their methods superior, in the face of highly suc- cessful American performance. Also 1t is not known that as rec recently as the conference at Casa blanca, Churchill argued with Major Gen. Ira Baker for two hours in an effort to convert him to night bombing.

 Churchill used all his persua- stve magnetism to press home the point that American bomberS rec quire fighter escort for daylight protection, that they need such heavy arnor and armament that their bomb load is only Q third or a fourth of the British, and that bad weather prevents precision bombing a large part of the time.

 But Gen. Baker held his ground. He has been fully supported by Gen. Fl. H. 'Hap"" Arnold, Chief of the Air Forces, with the result that American methods will not be changed.

 Inside fact aboHt this friendly

 allied argument is that Ameri- can methods are rapidly proving superior to British. Key to the

 whole question is the damage done to the enemy. American planes are not only hitting their

 targets with remarkable pre- cisiOn but they are drawing into action so many Maxi fighters. and knocking so many out of Che sky, that the Luftwaffe is disintegrating.

 WARS MOST

 SENSATIONAL NEWS

 This is no figure of speech. Ac- tually 1t is the most sensational news of the war. The American Air Force in Britain has received information on Germany's air power-or lack of it-which in- dicates that Nazi fighter planes are being destroyed so rapidly that there must be complete turn- over just about every four months.

 In other words. Allied forces are now destroying the total German fighter strength at the rate of about three times a year. This means that all the German fighters in existence on Janu- ary 1 should be destroyed by April %, and Germany should have left only those fighters built since January 1.

 Obviously 1t is desirable to strike the aircraft plants producing the fighters. which may be the req son behind the recent American raid on the Focke-Wulf plant in Bremen, a city which the British have raided a score of times with out knocking out that plant.

 Here again is the difference be- tween ''area bombing"" and ''pre- cision bombing. The British send over a great weight of bombs and lay down a blanket which is sup- posed to cover eVerytntng TOT acres. But they missed bomb loads. knocked out by the simple process of turning the bomb-sight on the target, in broad daylight, and then letting go with every thing.

 SUICIDAL"" U. S. RAIDS

 This accuracy has amazed the British without convincing them. They were first amazed last Aug. n, when the Americans, against British protests, staged their first daylight raid over the Continent. Thu British said 1t was suicidal, but the Flying F0rtresses laid down their seggs"" on Rouen. and came back without a single loss. The RAP had estimated that casualties would be 50 to 100 per cent.

 It was five months after this, at Casablanca, that Churchill tried to take Baker into camp."

Any thought of overseas intervention
by the United States in the present war
must now be ruled out. The problem for
this or the next administration to solve
will be that of keeping an enemy from
our gates.


Europe on British lines is finished.
The defeated nations will become totali-
tartan by treaties; those which have
managed to keep out of war-the states
of the Danubian basin, Sweden, Switzer-
land, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Tur-
key-will dovetail their national policies
with Berlin and Rome.


Great Britain still talks about fighting
to the bitter end. Her position is des-
perate. Allies she has none. The British
Isles have food for about six weeks-with
careful rationing. Even if landing oper-
ations of German troops should prove
impossible because of defensive organiza-
tion of the isles and the presence of the
fleet along the coasts of Britain and
Ireland, Germany can starve out the
British.


Aerial attacks destroying the stores

true that the British have improved their
aviation in the last few weeks and are
reported to have now between 1000 and
5000 bombers and fighters. Germany
still has several times that number and
by sacrificing even half her force would
make British resistance useless. Mastery
of the seas might help the empire but
not the kingdom.

This eventuality is discounted here. The
French have learned what an honorable
peace means . 1t is complete surrender
For Britain it would mean the loss of all
colonies and possessions and the destruc-
ton of everything Great Britain and the
British people have lived by during sew
eral centuries. The French are used to
defeat They have always managed to
come back, somehow or other. Their
greatness was based on France-on Euro
pean France. Britains greatness is based
on its overseas possessions. Britain has
never been invaded in the real sense
OF the word as France has. Peace terms
slmilar-at the best-to those of France
would mean the total disappearance of
the British Empire. Hence, Washington
believes, Britain will fight as long as she
is able to hold out, and there is little
likelihood that she will follow Marshal
Petain's example.


2. Britain may decide to carry on
from her dominions with the hope of
eventually obtaining support from the
Americas.


A suggestion that the capital of the
empire would be moved to Canada. or to
Australia, would have been received a.
lew months ago with loud laughter Now
1t Is possibility-even a probability.


Navy All Britain Can Save.


All that Great Britain can save today
is her navy-and possibly a number of
airplanes. The navy is divided in two:
One portion is in the home waters, in
the Atlantic; the other portion is in the
Mediterranean. 1t is conceivable that
the Atlantic fleet. after taking on board
as many trained soldiers as possible, will
make for Canada while the Mediter-
ranean feet viii make dash for the
Pacific and the bases at Singapore and
the Indian Ocean. There the ships
would no longer be threatened by Ger
man aviation and could meet any attack
from enemy submarines even if the JAP
anese and the Italo-German forces were
to unite.


Responsible quarters here believe that
the dictators will obtain only few units
belonging to France. Those which do
not join the British forces voluntarily
will be destroyed by the British before
being allowed to leave the fleet forma-
tions. Mr.. Chamberlain, considering
such an action unethical and without
precedent in international law, might
have hesitated to do this. Mr.. Churchill
has no such scruples.


The present British Government is
willing, it is said, to leave the civilian
population of the Isles at the mercy of
the Germans and hopes to be able to
carry on the war-even if it takes an
other decade or more-from the do
minions. Canada and Australia are re-
ported to have fallen in with such a
scheme.


In certain responsible quarters in
Washington the plan is looked upon
favorably. The position of this country
appears at present to be as follows:

English officials are said to be
reconciled to American criticism of
English politics. but they wish it
were universally accepted in the
United States that England is in the
war up to its neck. Viscount Halifax,
the British Ambassador, is carrying
the burden of this battle of educa-

been in frequent consultation with
American off1cials on the subject.


Reveals German Losses.


Ambassador Halifax took to the

within three weeks to shatter the
contentious Of those who hold that
England Is letting others fight the
war for her. He brought out in
formation about English successes
and prospects and German losses
which hitherto have been kept

With spring approaching, the Am

He said the British count no sacri-

Speaking on coast-to-coast

Ambassador, with Prime Minister
Churchill's authority, gave the
American public facts and figures
which. he said, will help you to
realize how far your ally has gone
along the hard road of an allout
total war effort""


During these two and q half years
OF war the British Army has fought
from the Arctic Circle through
Western and Southeastern Europe,
North and East Africa, the Near
East and the Far East down to the
equator"" the Ambassador said after
he commented that the Axis propa-
gandist are fond Of asking, What
is the British Army doing?'""


The English Army's record is one
OF varying success and failure; but
its record is one of valor and sacri-
fee and certainly not one Of mac
ton. To the end Of 194l, OF all the
casualties suffered by the armies OF
the British Commonwealth, over 10
per cent were sustained by troops
from Great Britain.

never be sure just what our strength
is going to be- That's one Of the rea-
sons why the Germans are keeping
more and more troops idle in West

Above all else, this army is holding

Chairman Of the British Labor Party.


LONDON (By Wireless) ""A friend
has just sent me two issues Of the
New York Times dated July % and
80. in which two eminent American
journalists Arthur Krock and
Henry Hazlitt, discuss the impact of
the British elections upon what
Krock calls ""realists"" in the United
States, by which term he describes
men like Cordell Hull, B. M. Baruch
and Jesse Jones. He explains that
their international economic policy
aimed at preservation OF our ma
tional economy and living standard""
purpose he seems to regard as diff
ferent from that entertained by
New Dealer-I use Krocks term
like Henry Wallace.


He explains that these influential
men will, on the return Of President
Truman, seek to impress"" him that
the Labor governments program Is
more than Great Britain can afford
and can only be financed by Amer
lean aid. They'll tell him that
America ought to assist Britain ito
all ends that will make for good
Anglo-American relations and help
restore peacetime conditions"" every
where as an outcome OF Labor's
program and that it should not
underwrite state socialism""


Now they think American eco
nomic policy must be revised. Haz-
lit writes, If more generally, in
much the same strain. He says
ut would seem a strange paradox
If American capitalism were to be
asked to subsidize British or conti-
mental Socialism in its early stages"" !""
The impression they create is that
Anglo economic relations
have been profoundly and adversely
affected by the failure Of Britain
to fulfill the expectation OF free
enterprise"" irf the United States
that Churchill would win with
working majority.


Summary Of Opinion.


think this is a fair summary of
what Krock and Hazlitt described
as the climate of American business
opinion generally. and of an i'm
portant group known to have great
influence in the White House in
particular. The inferences which
follow it are of outstanding import
ance. II Krock and Hazlitt are cor
rect, President Truman is to be in
fluenced toward presenting Prime
Minister Attlee and his colleagues
with what amounts to the following
body of theories:


Fipsts-aAmerican economic policy
in the foreign sphere was built on
the expectation of Churchills VIC
tory, the administration would then
have been encouraged to cooperate
with Britain in every way.


+ We are not told with precision
what changes: but we are led to as
sumo that cooperation could be
extended to Churchill which Attlee
could not expect unless he aban-
doned the program for which he
was elected. Attlee must therefore
either refuse to implement his man
date or, as I understand the
Krock- -Hazlitt thesis, Truman will
be urged to return to economic
isolationism.


Still omitting the second theorem,
the Krock- -Hazlitt thesis by impli-
cation goes very much further. It
informs British bankers and manu-
facturers that important American
circles regard an attempt to carry
out the will Of the British people as
likely to result in a ""demoralized
British economy"" for which there
will be no American aid. This be-
comes virtually an invitation to
them to urge British public opinion
either to throw out the Attlee gov
ernment or compel it to practice
continuity in economic policy"" with
the Churchill government.


Second, but Britain returned Att
lee with a sweeping Socialist ma
jority for naturalization of certain
industries. We do not believe this
can be accomplished without Ameri-
can aid.


Three, but once we believe that
if this aid is given the Socialist
program would result in ""demoral-
lied British economy"" we recon-
mend that such aid be given.


Four. we believe further that this
program is a threat to American
free enterprise


Five, American capital must not
be used to assist any state which
favorS Socialism.


Six, we are all for helping Britain
and promoting peace the world over
as long as economic policy abroad
conforms to our requirements.


Suggestion Challenged.


! omit for the moment the ques-
tion of whether Attlee's government
can fulfill their election pledges
without financial aid from America
This apart, the Krock- -Hazlitt pro-
gram is an announcement that on
the economic plane the -Four Free
doms can only be achieved in q
capitalist way. Any attempt to
realize them in Socialist terms will
lead to changes in the economic
foreign policy of the United States.


Policy Assailed.


To speak quite frankly, this is
dollar diplomacy in excelsis. 1t is
like an unofficial Potsdam declara-
ton with the Attlee government in
stead of the Franco government as
the object to be destroyed. On the
one hand. 1t is indicating with, of
course, the delicacy of indirectness
that the sovereign power of Britain
Is in fact resident in Washington;

nounced the right to criticize official
actions, and it is exercising this
right vigorously over Mr.. Churchill's
foreign policy, especially in Greece,
and, to lesser degree, in Belgium
and Italy.


Greece is the touchstone. About
fortnight ago 1t was the storm
center of lively debate wherein the
Labor;tes took the lead in denounc-
ing the armed Intervention of Brit
ish troops in support of the Greek
government, despite the fact that
this government was attacked by
the radical EAM opposition with the
obvious intention of overthrowing it
and seizing power themselves. Mr..
Churchill's critics have not been
mollified by his assurances that he
was not seeking to perpetuate any
Greek regime but merely trying to
aid the present government in es-
tablishing order. thereby making
possible the holding of elections to
decide what the Greek people as
whole wanted. The Laborites have
just forced a fresh debate on the
issue, wherein Mr.. Churchill has re-
fused to give ground.


1t is both curious and instructive
to contrast the Laborite attitude on
Greece with that on Poland. OBJ
viously moved by what he deemed
stern necessity, the Prime Minister
has virtually abandoned his support
of the Polish government in exile
and virtually indorses Soviet Russia's
claim to Eastern Poland by uni
lateral action, regardless of Polish
opposition. This is certainly more
drastic and arbitrary than Britain's
intervention in Greece for temporary
purposes. Yet most of the Laborites
warmly approved Churchill's atti-
tude on Poland. It was among his
own Conservative colleagues that
criticism was fairly widespread.


From the viewpoint of strict logic.
this leaves both the Laborites and
Mr.. Churchill open to charges of in
consistency, since they advocate
courses in Greece and Poland, which
are almost diametrically opposed to
each other. ALI this suggests party
cleavages beneath the surface tenn
porarily overlaid by the imperative
need for wartime unity. But, with
the lessening of common peril. they
emerge once more into the political
arena,"

Mr.. Casey succeeds in Cairo Capt.
Oliver Lyttelton, who became Min

Churshill's cabinet shake-up last
month. He fought in the Near East
during the World War, but he has
no political experience in that part
of the world, where Australian troops
have borne much of the fighting
burden.


He came to Washington two years
ago almost to the day as Australia's S
first Minister to the United States,
leaving the post of Treasury Min
lister in the Australian cabinet.


The appointment of DR.. Evatt TO
Mr.. Caseys post here would serve
as emphatic restatement by Aus
tralia of how important it considers
the United States to Australia. DR..
Evatts office has been the channel
through which Mr.. Casey has been
communicating from Washington to

Evatt's wife is Americen-born.

Prime Minister Winston Churchill's
grimly frank report to the House
OF Commons yesterday on the Allied
retreat from Flanders was cloaked
with no rhetorical camouflage to
spare the feelings of the British peo-
pie. Yet, with all it's solemnity, it
was an inspiring message of deter
mination and hope, rather than of
despair and defeatism From the
heroism of the British and French
and Belgian soldiers on the bloody
fields of Flanders the regimented
forces of totalitarianism have learned
something of the indomitable brav-
cry of free peoples forced to bear
arms in defense of their principles
and of their homes; from the delib-
crate words of Englands Prime
Minister the dictators could learn
much. Certainly they are finding
that it takes more than dive -bombers
and tanks and machine guns to crush
the spirit of free men.


Mr.. Churchill's address provided
answers for many of the questions
which have been swirling in the
minds of Americans and others who
have been shocked and confused by
the cataclysmic rush of events In
Europe. He has left no room for
doubt as to these important facts:
That the Allies have suffered a
colossal military disaster; that,
despite this catastrophe, they enter
tain no thoughts of vanquishment
nor of surrender; that the truly
miraculous escape of the British ex-
peditionary force and of it's French
and Belgian Allies from the claws of
DEATH"" which only yesterday
succeeded in swapping shut at Dun
kerque, paves the way for recon-
struction and consolidation of the
Allied front; and that the subjuga-
ton of England would not mean that
the sun had set upon the British
Empire.


The crisis which confronts the
Allies-and, indirectly, the worlds
remaining democracies-is so grave
that no good can come of avoiding
the facts, of indulging in further
wishful thinking of the type to which
Britain and France and the other
democratic nations have clung SO
hopefully and so futilely in recent
years. Aggression in its mightiest,
most fearsome form is on the
march-and is flushed with victory.
Totalitarianism has ceased to be
merely the bombast of blatant die
tators; it has materialized into a
mechanical monster that threatens
to devastate all who dare oppose it.
Britain and France have accepted
the challenge and they are paying a
frightful price-but the epic with
draWal from Flanders, the gallant
sacrifices of the garrisons at Calais
and Dunkerque, the near-incredible
salvation of more than 100000 brave
men who had been virtually given
up for lost-all these things have
given the Allies and their friends
new heart for the even darker days
which loom ahead


The trials and tribuations Of Brit
ain and France are far from over.
AS Mr.. Churchill succinctly put it,
Wars are not won by excavations""
Sterner and more ferocious blows,
aimed at the heart of these two great
nations are just starting If America
can ease those blows, or turn them to
the disadvantage of the attackers, it
behooves us to do so with the utmost
speed. We have procrastinated too
long as it is-and with every days
delay the threat of war is being
brought closer and closer to our
shores.


1t is matter of inestimable i'm
portance to our own security that
we should instantly remove all
restrictions on the rendering of
realistic, material aid to the Allies,
while there remains some hope of
their eventual triumph. And there
will be hope as long as there prevails
in England and France such an
unquenchable spirit of fortitude and
such will to win"" as Allied soldiers
and statesmen have exhibited in
recent days."

From the New York Times:","


It would be wholly unjustifable to
drop or minimize any program of
economic cooperation with Great Bri-
tain because we must deal with Mr..
Attlee instead of Mr.. Churchill. No one
could seriously propose that there should
be any change in lease-lend policies for
that reason. If America extends post
war aid to Britain or to any other ma
ton, either in the form Of loans or
outright contributions, we have a right
in return, Of course, to an assurance
that the country to which such aid Is
given will refrain from policies likely
to reduce the greatest possible home
production or the greatest possible
amount OF self-help. We want to feel
not merely from our own standpoint
but from that of the country being
aided, that our help is doing the greatest
amount of good, and that our own
people are not being asked to bear
deprivations in vain. Particular loans
or contributions may therefore properly
be made subject to definite understand
ings. But no discrimination against any
government on the mere general eround
that 1t is more to the right or to the
left than we should like can be tolerated
IN our foreign policy."

powers do not at all relish our safe
guarding of Iceland by landing naval
and marine forces. Officially they
have not yet defined their attitude,
but their inspired press and Spokes-
men have expressed themselves with
acid vigor


A Berlin newspaper recognized as
a mouthpiece of the Foreign Othce
presumably sets the official tone by
calling our entry into Iceland a stab
in the back while Europe is Strug-
| Cling with BolSheviSm for the pres
ervation of European civilization.
| One German spokesman asserts that
From a military point of view, these
troops might as we'll be in British
port"" while another observes sar-
castically that americans have
made the term Western Hemisphere
sort of movable geographical con-
ception.""


Rome comment is less specific and
somewhat less heated. The emphasis
is laid upon what is termed ""a genu-
inc intervention in European waters
which one newspaper calls another
step toward the precipice"" of open
warfare between America and the
Axis. Since Iceland is in the war
zone proclaimed by Germany after
British troops occupied the island
last year, and since German sub
marines have long been active in the
vicinity, both Berlin and Rome be-
lieve that hostile incidents between
German and American naval or air
forces are almost inevitable.


The fact that the Axis govern
ments have not yet formally spoken
doubtless is due to two good rea-
sons. In the first place, there is
nothing that they can really do
about the matter, especially at
moment when they are preoccupled
with Russia. And that, in turn,
probably renders them less than ever
inclined to precipitate an open
breach with the United States.


The attitude of Japan, the third
Axis partner, is even more cautious
officially, and its spokesmen are
notably restrained. The japanese
Army spokesman in China intimates
that his government might use our
action in Iceland as precedent for
similar protective"" Japanese actions
in the Far East. Asked about reports
of an impending japanese move into
Southern Indo-China, the Spokes-
man, Major Akiyama, replied: Just
as the United States did not an
nounce the Navy was in Iceland until
it was occupied, we cannot make an
announcement about future mat
ters.""


In sharp contrast with Axis dis
pleasure is Britain's cordiality. The
London press hailed the news OF
Americas entry into Iceland with
enthusiasm, and this has been quick
ly followed by official approval in a
statement by Prime Minister Winston
Churchill before the House of Com
mons. Foreseeing effective co-opera-
ton between the British and Amer
ican Navies in Icelandic waters, he
hailed our action as lone of the most
important things that has happened
since the war began""


One of the more interesting points
in Mr.. Churchills speech was his
statement: I'VE still propose to re-
tain our army in Iceland"" First re-
ports had been to the effect that the
large British garrison, estimated at
10000 or more, would be withdrawn
for service elsewhere. 1t would now
seem that British and American land
forces are destined to cooperate on
the island as the navies will do off
shore.


Meanwhile, the Icelandic people
themselves appear to be we'll salts
fed with all that is taking place. In
this connection, the Swedish press is
voicing discreet approval. So, out
side of the Axis, everybody concerned
seems to be content."

affairs. Mr.. Churchill set the example
on his last trip this way and IN later ut
terances. 1t appears to us as especially
off color at this time when every effort
POSSIBLE is being made to see that our
fighters get the ballot. Many hundreds
of thousands of these fighters are doml-
ciled in England and others are on Brit
ish soil in North Africa and still other
thousands are fighting side by side with
British soldiers and sailors.


One of the difficult and contested
points in providing ballots for our over
seas men is the manner in which they
shall be informed on campaign candi-
dates and issues. 1t is not our notion
of this phase Of the problem for the Bit
ish to be self-appointed agents. Inc
Guardian is not frank open IN its state
ment. 1t doesn't need to herald its right
TO discuss American politics. 1t always
has had that prerogative, Just as our
press has felt. free to discuss Brltaln's

out and say what it intends TO do and be
done with it. Churchill thinks it would
be calamity to eject anyone other than
oRosevelt this fall. There are those in
this country who feel the same way but

outsider.

Minister Churchill told the
House Of Commons today that
the British Army had only 100
tanks on June II, 1910, to face
the threat of German invasion
after the fall of France.


Even these tanks, the Prime Min
lister said, were of a type found in
the battle of France to be too
weak to stand up against German
anti-tank guns.


""The invasion of this country was
expected If not in the autumn of
1910, at any rate in the spring of
1941 or even 1912"" he said.


In less than year, Mr.. Churchill
noted, an entirely new tank had
been conceived and put into guam
tity production. The Army had 400
by the autumn of 1941 and now
has between 1000 and 1000, he
said.


These tanks have been surpassed
by later models and were designed"

Cabinet Representative


To Work on Problem",Nv the Associated Press.,"~ the Associated Press.


LONDON, Feb. 23.-At least par
tial realization of India's long and
often bloody demands for independ-
ence was predicted by British sources
today after a rapid sequence OF
weekend events which portended a
radical change in Britain's attitude
toward her 400, 0,000, 900 subjects there.


Two developments particularly
buoyed India's hopes:


I. The farewell of Chinese Gen.
erahssimo Chang Kai-shek, who has
been visiting in India. Speaking
presumably with the consent Of
Britain and the United States and
apparently addressing himself to the
British, he declared dramatically
Saturday:


1.-THE vast majority of the worlds
opinion is in full sympathy with
India's aspiration for freedom""


2. Informed British sources as
serted yesterday that Prime Min
lister Churchill planned to enlarge
1ndia's powers of self-government
and send a cabinet representative
there to try to put the India prob
lem on a more satisfactory footing""


Nehru May Get Post.


There was as yet no precise indi-
cations of how far Britain would go
toward granting autonomy, but the
government was said to be planning
tentatively for an Indian national
administration headed by ,Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, former president
of the National Congress party in
which Mohandas K. Gandhi has
been the guiding spirit.


Neither the Congress Party nor
the All-India Moslem League, which
represent the bulk of the politically
iterate in India's population, have
formulated a stand on Gen. Chiang's
message of hope to its masses.


The AIl-India Moslem Leagues
Working Committee was called to a
special meeting today, however. and
q conference of Indian leaders out
side the two great political parties
yesterday voted support for Gen.
Chang.


Meeting under the noted liberal,
Sir Tel Bahadur Sapru, they re-
solved to advocate immediate Brit
ish measures to give India rank
with other self-governing units OF
the commonwealth and reconstruc-
ton of the governor generals execu-
tive council as national govern

They asked also that India's rep
resentatiyes in the British war cab
met and on the Pacific war council
be non-oficial and representative
of the people India was invited
on February II to send representa-
tives to those bodies.


""I hope and believe that Britain,
without waiting for any demand on
the part of the Indian people will,
as speedily as possible, give them
real political power"" Gen. Chlang
said in his farewell.


The Indian press adopted show
me attitude. exemplifled by the edl-
torial comment of the Bombay
Chronicle: will Britain Respond?
True settlement with the people of

that the generalissimo, having
spoken so plainly to India"" now

British"" 1t expressed confidence
that his advice would be taken,

The India issue has been a barrier
to realization of the country's full
war potential and British sources

intentions as an effort to consolidate
the empire front in Asia.

short channel crossing to be navi-
gated, but a stretch of the Mediter-
ranean Sea itself-assuming that
most of the evacuees returned to
Egypt rather than to Crete, where
Greece's government-in-exile has
established itself. That the men are
back in Africa is the inference
to be drawn from Prime Minister
Churchill's statement that the troops
have arrived safely at their bases.


The British say they suffered about
5000 casualties in Greece, including
dead and wounded, with 5000 men
unaccounted for. The German high
command has claimed capture of
5000 Britishers. The British losses
are extraordinarily small, considering
the one-sidedness of the struggle and
the effectiveness of the delaying
action fought by the retiring divi-
sions. No estimate of German cas-
ualties has been obtained from Berlin,
but London asserts that the Nazi
losses were much greater than those
of the British.


Mr.. Churchill gave only sketchy
details in his preliminary report on
the escape from Greece, but he
promised full account next week.
Until then it would be risky to at
tempt an accurate appraisal of the
Allied disaster in the Balkans or to
estimate the possible effects of the
return to other fronts of so large
a proportion of Wavell's battlewise
warriors."

Britains unfortunate Intervention In
Greece was not prompted by any desire

 The crux of the controversy, of course, is that MT. Hull still believes in appeasing Vichy, and the British gave that up long ago.

 The British say that General DeGaulle did most of the fighting for the Allied cause in Syria, while Vichy, in resisting, killed many British troops. So they are going to stick with EcC IL.

 Winston Churchill didn't drop in on the President when he re- turned to the White House after his smash-hit speech to Con- gress. Neither did he immediately resume his crowded schedule of conferences.

 The first thng the Prime Min lSter did was buy a bag of pea nuts.

 A messenger was sent out to make the nickel purchase from Steve, famous Greek peanut vendor who holds forth outside the White House grounds at East East Executive and Pennsylvania avenues.

 Then Churchill walked out into the garden behind the executive mansion and fed the squirrels, for which, like Falla, the Presi- dents dog, the Prime Minister developed a great fondness.

 Not until the bag of peanuts was emptied did Churchill plunge into the turbulent business of war.

man troops. The relatively few who
heard 1t may not have understood, but
the dispatches telling of 1t and the
broadcasts that were no doubt sent out
later over our short-wave stations to
the interior of Europe also telling about
1t will be heard by many, many millions.


\ \


1t is these millions still living under
the Nazi yoke who sooner or later must
come to understand that the United
Nations do not stand before them as
would-be oppressors or vindictive con-
querorS of their lives but as trustees for
them and their children. That trus-
teesh1p will mean severe punishment
for the guilty, but it cannot mean en-
slavement for the innocent.


Too many persons are ready to push
aside as superf1uous or contradictory
such things as Easter services at the
front. These matters, they will say, are
not proper In war where the main ex-
perience is to kill or be killed. But
the strength of an honest cause Is more
powerful than any physical weapons the
world has ever made or used. If some-
how the speeches Of the President and
Prime Minister Churchill and Marshal
Stain could begin to exude the same
deep faith in the qualities Of human
brotherhood as were expressed In that
Easter service at Casino, the men who
fight on our side and the men on the
other side would derive renewed faith
that the sacrifices they now are making
will somehow some day bring q better
world, world of higher moral values
and a world Of peace built on the only
foundations that can endure -- the
philosophy of human love.

NEW YORK, May 28.-With less
than two weeks to 60 before the list
running of the Kentucky Derby, the
field has narrowed to where the WIN

Col. C. v. Whitney's Jeep; War Jeep,

A dozen or more 3-year-olds are
expected to face the barrier at
Churchill Downs June 9, but If the
victor in the $4,000 added run for
the roses is not one of these six, the
race will go down as surprise.
Wednesdays running of the mile
and 10 yards of the Wood Memorial
at Jamaica may eliminate further
some of those now under consider

Bradley's hopes of winning his
fifth Derby were given a big boost
Saturday when Burning Dream won
the mile of the Derby Trial at the
Downs. The time of 1885 was not
sensational, but he left behind him
such talked-of 3-year -olds as c. c.

agreed only after making it clear

Since the turn of the war in favor
of the Allies, the United States has
been calling for ""get-tough"" policy
toward all countries selling goods
which might cost lives. Britain,
meanwhile, has been insisting that
each country be treated in the light

Little Pressure on Portugal.
For instance, Portugal, although
Britain,s oldest ally, has wolfram

Prime Minister Churchill gave the
House of Commons yesterday. He
was acquainting it with details of an
action in which naval air force
bombers crippled two Italian battle
ships, including one of the brand
new 35,000-ton Littorio class, and
probably damaged a third. OF Mus
Solini's six capital ships, only three
now remain battleworthy, and the
British Admiralty communique also
announces that two Italian cruisers
and two feet auxiliaries were heavily
struck.


Mr.. Churchill described events al
Taranto as ""a glorious episode""
They not only affect conditions in
the Mediterranean, he explained, but
react upon the naval situation in
every quarter Of the globe"" BY put
ting half Of Italy's Capital ships out
of action, it becomes possible to
release powerful units Of the British
Mediterranean armada for several
essential purposes-pursuit of the
German pocket battleship now
commerce-raiding in mid Atlantic,
strengthening of British forces in
the battle for Egypt and the Near
East, and dispatch, If necessary, of
fleet units to bolster the position
in the Pacific, freshly menaced by
japanese activities in Indo-Chino, in
the direction of Singapore.


It is the alteration of the Mediter-
ranean picture which is of immedi-
ate Importance With Italy's sea
power decimated, she is appreciably
less capable of lending naval support
to the land and air forces threaten
ing Egypt and the Suez Canal from
the direction Of Libya. The task of
defending Gibraltar against Italo-
German attack by land, sea and air
is also facilitated. Italy's fleet is the
principal challenge to British COM
mand of the Mediterranean and the
empire life line to the east. That
menace is considerably lessened by
the brilliant blow the air arm of the
Royal Navy delivered at laramie.
The effect on the Grecian campaign
should be distinctly unfavorable for II
Duce's ill-starred legions and it will
augment British prestige throughout

World Bridge Olympic Of 1910, re-

ends Of the earth. In this round
the-world contest of contract ex-
perts, the North and South cham
pions were ]. M. Learmonth and Z.
Learmonth, both Of Maracaibo,
Venezuela, while the East and West
victors were Mrs. A. G. Bryant and
Mrs. G. H. Drury, both Of Ketchi-
kan, Alaska.


Due to war conditions in Europe
and Asia, the Olympic Committee In
New York which prepared the l6
pre-fixed par"" deals played In the
contest, was delayed in receiving
returns from many remote places,
and the international leaders could
not be determined until all reports
had been submitted and examined.
Only 10 countries participated In
the event. whereas there were play
ers in AZ different countries last
year. War prevented England and
France and most Of the middle
European nations from taking part,
but nevertheless there were Olympic
games In India, Australia, New
Zealand and even in China and
Japan. South American countries
showed increased activity, and as
a result two citizens of Venezuela
captured first place in the inter-
national honors.


The match was conducted under
the auspices Of the American Con-
tract Bridge League, which from
time to time has made known the
national and State winners as the
score sheets were proven, but the
winners of the grand prize were
not announced until after the last
returns were In from Central China,
which required more than two
months for transmission.


The American champions for 1910
are G. r. Trimmer and T. d.
Keating. both of GLASGOW, Mont.

every province Of Canada.


Local winners were s. G.

Cy Austin, North and South, and
AL Roth and o. J. Brotman, East
and West. Since the Olympics, Mr..
Roth and Mr.. Brotman have won
the master pair championship of
Maryland in Baltimore and the
District master pair championship
in Washington.


Maryland Olympic winners were
Mrs. H. E. Whitaker and DR.. w. L.
Badger OF Baltimore, North and

East and West. Virginia winners
were Miss Gladys ingalls, and Mrs.

Stella Kaplan, Weston, East and
West.


Last years winners in the summer
national tournament of the Amer
lean Contract Bridge League will
defend their championships in all
put one event at Asbury Park, N. j.
IN the meet beginning this week.
The exception will be the worlds
championship masters pair contest
won In 1899 by Harry J. Fishbein
and Robert Appleyard. Both will
enter the contest but will not play
together.


In the other masters events. the
-Four Aces combination of Oswald

striving for another victory. The
Four Aces have won this event four
times IN the five years 1t has been
played. Jacoby, paired with John
Crawford, youthful Philadelphia
experts, also will defend the mems
national title. Mrs. Ralph c. Young,
Philadelphia, and Mrs. A. M. Sobel,
New York, will join in defense of
the women's pair crown.


A large delegation from Washing

Churchill made his threat

either Athens or Cairo was bombed.


Although Athens could have been
attacked easily from the air be-

The Germans bombed right up to

Restrictions Likely
To Be Indefinite","BY BUS HAM,

With the proclamation of We day,
expected any time, removal of the
ban on racing probably will be the
first Government action directly af-
fecting sports.


Some racing officials who hereto
fore have declined to comment on
when the billion-dollar sport might
be resumed said yesterday they had
learned that the ban will be lifted
We day or within hours there
after""


Otherwise, the immediate effect Of
We day on sports will be principally
psychological, with a feeling that
much of the wartime pressure is off.


Gradual relaxation, however, Of
some restrictions which have
pinched sports hard apparently is in
the cards, although such problems
as manpower and transportation
will remain indefnitely-probably
through the war with Japan.

hoped the list anniversary date,

could be celebrated by a formal an
nouncement of the end of the Gov
ernment's shutdown of the tracks.
which went into effect last jan
uary g.


White House Mum Officially.
| The Derby, established in 1875. Is
traditionally run the first Saturday
in May, but the White House still
had nothing to say officially.
/ President Truman in his first news
conference April II left the racing
question up in the air by saying he
did not intend to lift the ban before
We day, and that he did not then
have the answer as to what would
happen on or after We day.


But racing officials said they had
found out in the past few days that
the ban will be lifted by the White
House along with other We day de-
velopments.


If We day is declared soon, they
added that the Kentucky Derby may
be run June 2, with the other two
events in racing's triple CROWN the
Pimlico and Belmont Stakes, coming
June 9 and June %, respectively.


Early Effects on Colleges Seen.


AS the weeks roll by after We
day, returning discharged service
men slowly will increase the num-
Der of athletes available. College
athletics, which have been using
mainly teen-age competitors. may
be among the first to feel the
strengthening effects of this addi-
tional material


Transportation restrictions will
remain, however. The Office of De-
Tense Transportation says that its
burden will be even greater after
We day in moving men and equip
ment to the Pacific theater of war.
/ A 15-point program for cutting
travel by college teams has been SUBJ
mitted to the ODT which said today
that the principal points presumably
will be put into effect.


Baseball took the lead in volun-
tarily curtalling travel, other sports
have followed suit, and these re-
ductiors will stand through 1945 or
until Japan is crushed, the ODT
said.

transfer the government to French
Africa and continue the war from
there and was opposed by Petain and
Gen. Maxine Weygand, command

forces.

TTHE letter of the Tablet to Mr. Russell
Il follows:


LETTER TO STATE DEPARTMENT


BROOKLYN, Sept. IL
Dear Mr. Russell:


In Mondays New York Times, in a
letter to Bishop Lewis o. Hartman, you
are quoted as discussing the attitude of
the state department toward Spain.


Since you explicitly express the official
position Of the state department and since
YOU state that the views IN the letter
reflect 1.-The feeling of the American
people"" we would appreciate the opportu-
nifty Of criticizing your letter, both as
American citizens and as part Of the body
Of the American people.


You stated, according to the New
York Times


""The department recognizes and shares
fully the feeling of the American people
that there should be established in Spain
forms of government which would give TO
the Spanish people the opportunity to
achieve their political aspirations. The
question of how to use our influence, in thu
best and most effective manner, and to
aid in the achievement of these objectives
in an orderly and peaceful way, is receiv-
ing constant study by officers of the
department""


VXTOULD you kindly inform. us how
w you ascertaned 1.-The feeling of the
American people,? as close students of
the propaganda against Spain (and other
nations positively opposed to the spread
of Soviet communism within their borders)
we have observed no agitation for change
of regime in Spain or for interference in
the internal government of that nation,
except in the Communist press, until re-
cent weeks


The Coffee resolution, to which Bishop
Hartman referred in the Times article,
was given little publicity at the time
of its introduction except in the Daily
Worker.


The committees which have been
organized since that time as was to be
expected, represent apparently only iso-
lated elements headed in most cases by
the usual personages associated with pro-
Soviet or pro-Communist international
movements and few innocent front men.


We have noted no expression of the
Feeling"" you mention in Congress or
anywhere else. Instead we find most
Americans agree with Winston Churchill,
who last May in commencing the present
Spanish government stated in regard to
the North African landings:


II shall always consider the service so
rendered at that time of Spain not only to
the United Kingdom and the British En-
pire and commonwealth but to the cause
of the United Nations. =. Internal pOlit-

a dangerous stage. Hitherto there have

military conduct of the war. it is likely
they will be badly received here and
possibly with the threat Of counter
measures

There have been three major political

Interpretation that has accumulated
around unconditional surrender; and
the third, the failure to produce any

The original manuscript of Arthur
Hugh Clough's poem Say Not the
Struggle Nought Availeth
by Winston Churchill in his broad
cast to the United States April 81
is to be exhibited at the Library Of
Congress.


Archibald MacLeiSh, librarian, has
announced the loan of the manu-
script by the British Prime Minister.
1t crossed the Atlantic in a dip
lomatic pouch and was delivered by
the British Ambassador, Lord
Halifax


The story of the writing of the
now famous verses is wrapped in
mystery and romance. According to
Mr.. MacLeish. Clough was in Rome
in the early summer of 1849 at the
time when Garibaldi was defending
that city against the French.

librarian says, that he composed
this lyric during those weary days
OF waiting. Back at his post at
University Hall, London, In the
autumn. Clough incorporated the
four stanzas in letter to his good
friend. William Allingham Although
they were not published until after
his death, they have brought the
poet his most enduring fame""


Mr. Churchill cited the eight final
lines Of Clough's work in his April
81 address. as follows:

Comes silent, flooding in the main.
And not by eastern windows only,


When daylight comes, comes in

slowly,


But westward look, the land is


bright""


The last line provides the title for
the new play by George S. kaufman
and Edna Ferber, The Land Is
Bright"" which opened last week in
Washington and now is playing In
New York


On June II the Clough manuscript

numbers and taken the Capital. But this
time it is peaceful invasion of military
and civilian experts, f1anked by several
corps of secretaries, clerks and inspectors,
who have come to coordinate the war
effort of the United States with that of
Great Britain.


The biggest organiza tion-the British
Supply Council in North America-has
staff of more than 1,500, most of them in
Washington. 1t took only about twice
that many redcoats to defeat the Amer
leans at the battle of Bladensburg in the
War of 1872. From Bladensburg they
marched on the Capital with decidedly
hostile intentions.


The present-day invaders are bursting
with good will working to bring about
the highest degree of cooperation in
British and American production efforts.
The list includes some of England's best
brains, men who have won distinguished
rank in several fields. And titles come
at 10 cents a dozen, with virtually every
other executive knight or a baron


Scramble for Office Space.


The Britishers have had a scramble to
find Office space in crowded Washington.
They have taken over apartments, pri-
vate dwellings and an entire floor of the
Willard Hotel. 1t is not surprising to
find Sir so-and-So with his Office in part
of a bathroom-plumbing fixtures re-
moved-with his secretary occupying
what has been serving pantry and his
staff in the former living room of the
apartment. All this is reminiscent of
the N. R. A., when Washington was full
to bursting, but not so crowded as is the
city today, what with the British in
vasion and the defense boom


1t is big business, of course, that the
British are conducting very big business.
AS measure of the scope of operations
of the Supply Council an average of $500
cablegrams day go in and out of the
councils various Offices in Washington
and New York.


Besides the Supply Council, there are
several British press organizations in
this country, all of limited scope. The
SCAAtA al SNlC1ItAA4S O111CC lldS live SCltIl-
lists in the United States to coordinate
wartime research. A small group from
the British Treasury, headed by Sir
Frederick Phillips, is working with Sec
retary Morgenthau. Representatives of
the chancellor of the exchequer are in
New York nquidating British securities.
Shipping experts from the Admiralty
and from private ship companies have
extensive New York offices.


Diplomatic Staff Expanded.


All this is in addition to the diplomatic
representation which has been greatly
expanded since the start of the war.
The huge British Embassy on Massa-
chusetts avenue is being enlarged to
take care of the new secretaries and at
taches on special mission. Lord Halifax,
as Ambassador. is the real policy making
spokesman, but there are many other
Britishers assigned to duties that are
almost as important.


Included within the Supply Council
are three organizations of primary i'm
portance: The British Purchasing Com
mission, the British Air Commission and
the delegation from the Admiralty. The
Purchasing Commission stems from the
Ministry of Supply, an important branch
of the Churchill government in London.
At the head of the Supply Council in
America is Arthur B. Purvis.


Purvis is a self-made man with a wide
range of business experience. Born in
England, he left school at rather early
age and went to Canada to make his
fortune. Unlike so many other Brit

Some labor leaders say the employ

any great extent for fear they would

postwar depression.


The employers themselves con-
tend publicly that it would do no
good to raise wages now since the
raise would automatically entail
higher production costs and conse-
quently still higher cost of living,
thus nullifying the additional
salary.


How labor responds to this argu-
ment was demonstrated by the
Amalgamated Engineering Union
the other day, which agreed only at
the eleventh hour to call off a strike,
after an appeal from one of it's
members. He had two sons fighting
for Britain, and demanded, when

Bevin Wins Cabinet Post.


When you ask labor leaders in
general what they want, they reply
it is better chance in the future
of a caste-ridden land that draws
most of its leaders from the per
cent of the population attending

One of their major fears is that
the war will jeopardize the advan-
tages they have managed to acquire
up to now. For instance, labor men
say they would like an ""iron-clad
guarantee of protection if their
ranks are to be opened to a flood of
new labor, which undoubtedly would
mean a postwar surplus of skilled
workmen.


Laborites say they appreciate the
augmented voice in national affairs
which the war has given them.
Ernest Bevin, one of their own
people, has replaced ""minerun
politician"" in the Labor Ministry
Mr.. Bevin in addition has won a
place on the important inner war
cabinet.


But Mr.. Bevin, they say, is in the
difficult position of trying to keep
both workers and employers happy
now.


On the labor conscription question,
labor sees the prospect of the gov
ernment dropping the kid glove
method for one of blunt command.


Conscription advocates, however,
believe it might be more palatable
to labor if administered by some one
like David Lloyd George. They
think the question would be taken
out of politics if the 78-year-old
elder statesman who has no AK to
grind"" were to enter the cabinet as
Munitions Minister with a blank
check to do anything necessary for
production of the necessary guns,
tanks and shells


Mr.. Bevin, often called England's
""next Prime Minister"" does not
agree.


If Mr. Lloyd George is not called,
informed London sources say, Mr..
Churchill may either have to swing
Mr.. Bevin around or draft the men
into the factories himself.


A bright spot in the picture has
been produced by Lord Beaverbrook
and his brand-new Ministry of Air
craft Production. ""The Beaver"" has
prodded labor, management and
government departments with equal
vigor to get the planes, planes,

he says that American planes are

Even Though Sacrifice Be Required.",,"To the Editor of The Star:


The United States is an important
world power, politically and economical
ly. We have been involved before in
the affairs of Europe and even now are
so deeply committed that there seems
to be no other way than to take our
place with the Allies and see this con-
f1ict through to the defeat of Nazi-ism
But is it not more sane and civilized
to sacrifice for peace rather than for
war?


In the first place, the slogan of the
interventionists, Britain is fighting our
battle and we must help her"" savors
too much of propaganda to be swal-
lowed whole. The battle was not ours
in the beginning, and certainly we did
not ask Britain to fight it for us And
no one can foretell the outcome whether
we enter the struggle or not.


Charles A. Lindbergh, who already has
proved that he knows what he is talking
about, and who doubtless has a clearer
and more complete understanding of the
situation in Europe than any of our
politicians, says that England, even with
our help, is not in a position to win.


On the other hand. there are those
who say that England has a good chance
to succeed. We are already furnishing
war material, ships and planes which
we probably ought to be accumulating
for ourselves against a possible need
for them in the future. We are sending
these supplies so that England may
fight with them, and Winston Churchill
himself said recently that enough Amer
ican shipping has been promised to
assure victory in the battle of the
Atlantic. If this be So why should
America go farther?

LONDON, Feb. 10. Informed
sources said today the 35,000-ton
battleships Anson and Howe, the
newest of the King George v. class,
soon would join the British fleet.


They based their statement on
Prime Minister Churchill's decla-
ration Tuesday that before the Ger

Gneisenau could be put in fighting
trim ""the Royal Navy will be rein
forced by various important units
of highest quality""


The Howe, originally named the
Beatty, was launched November II,
1899, and one source said she easily
could be in service or at least be
undergoing trials now. The same,
he added, was true of the Anson,
originally named the Jellicoe, which
was launched in 1910.


Five ships formed the class orig

Among Units Pouring
Into Madagascar

Repatriation Is Offered
French; Restoration Of
Island Is Promised",BY the Associated Press.,"BY the Associated Press.


LONDON, May 8.-The Daily
Mail published today dispatch
from Madrid which said that
according to reports from
Vichy,"" the source of which was
undisclosed, United States and
South African troops ""are pour
ing into Diego Suarez,"" the
Madagascar base just taken over
by the British.


Several hours after this report was
published there was no confirmation
from any source.


A Foreign ONCE commentator an
nounced that the British had offered
to repatriate any Frenchmen on
Madagascar who did not wish to
cooperate with the United Nations""
and pledged restoration of the is
land to France simultaneously with
the first landing on Madagascar
Tuesday.


Further Landings Necessary.


The first British landing resulted
in capture of the strategic Diego
Suarez naval base yesterday morn
ing, but military commentator
said further landings would be
necessary to obtain such vital
strategic points as the Tulear air
base if French resistance continued


The commentator said the offer
to the French was made to avoid
bloodshed' and was contingent on
French cooperation with the British
occupation forces.


He said, however, there was no
confirmation of reports that the
surrender terms at Diego Suarez in
cluded a cease fire"" order for all
French forces on the island, 28, 500
square miles in area.


Casualties Less Than 1000.


1t was reported that more than
one-half of the French troops on
the island were involved in the de-
fense of the Diego Suarez naval base,
which would mean that the sur
render there minimized the French
chances of real resistance elsewhere.


Prior to the British attack, the
French declared they were able to
mobilize 5000 soldiers on the island.


A Vichy news broadcast, however,
estimated the total French defense
force as 1000 men. This version
said only 1900 French troops had
been engaged in the fight in the
Diego SuareZ area, presumably leav-
ing more than 5000 holding positions
to the south.


British casualties in the conquest
OF the Diego Suarez Bay area may
be considerably less than 1000, it
was stated authoritatively.


Prime Minister Churchill had told
the House of Commons yesterday
the casualties may exceed the 1000
figure.


A military commentator said in
fantry units which advanced in the
first attack on Antsirana and had
been reported missing now were
known to have established them
selves in independent positions near
the town.


They held on under French attack
until the British assault captured
the town and rescued them from
encirclement.


These forces took a number of
French prisoners in the first land
ing at Courier Bay, followed by
headlong assault on French coastal
batteries overlooking the bay, the
commentator said.


The Foreign Office commentator,
in explaining the British offer to the
French, declared:


They Informed authorities that
the territory of Madagascar would
remain French and after the war
would be restored to French SOW
ereignty.


They further stated that if mem
oers of civil and military organiza-
lions declared their intention to CO.
operate with the United Nations
heir salaries and pensions would be
provided from funds to be made
available for that specific purpose.


""A guarantee of repatriation was
given civil and military personnel
who did not wish to cooperate with |
he United Nations and could claim
he right to reside in metropolitan
France. Repatriation would take
,lace when ships were available.


THE condition laid down by the
orce commanders was that no de-

LONDON, Oct. 28.-Both King
George vi and Prime Minister
Churchill have promised Greece
every possible help against the
Italian invaders in personal mes
sages to the Greek sovereign and
Prime Minister, it was learned
tonight.


The messages, from King George
vi of England to King George II of
Greece, and from Churchill to Pre-

aims positive"" assurances that she
intends to redeem the pledge of
support in the event of attack
which was given to Greece by the
Chamberlain government in April of
1899.


These assurances were dispatched
in response to Greece's appeal for
help. Presumably they were given
to Greek Minister Simopoulos when
he saw Foreign Secretary Lord Hal
flax at the Foreign Office this aft
ernoon.


Appeal Made Through Envoy.


Greece's Premier made his appeal
through Sir Michael Palairet, Brit
ish Minister to Greece.

ever, that the Mediterranean fleet
was already steaming to the aid of
Greece, authoritative sources said
they had no information whatever
on the possible beginning Of a
British campaign.


Former Premier Neville Cham
berlain gave Greece the British
guarantee on April 13. 1899. when
he said: In the event of any action
being taken which clearly threatens
the independence of Greece or Ru-
mania, and which Greek or Ru-

government, as the case may be, all

Greeks Have Kept Calm.


Military circles in London said
Italy was known to have 10 or II
divisions in Albania and additional
auxiliaries comprising total of ap-
proximately 100000 men. Included
are one armored division and one
crack Alpine division.


Italy had done her very best to
make Greece abandon neutrality""
authoritative sources asserted, but
the Greeks have maintained the
most admirable calm. All they've
done is take necessary defense

from the Humboldt Bay Lifeboat

were too dangerous for a larger

through intermittent rain squalls

About O'Clock next morning the

port bow that proved to be a long.

no response to light signals. and as
the lifeboat continued on. the other

ram it. the announcement related.


Chief Churchill changed his
course quickly and avoided being
struck. Positive Identification was
impossible due to darkness, but a
later check showed no United States
vessels in this area at that time.


The lifeboat continued on its
course, and after finding no signs
of life on board the Emidio started
back toward the Humboldt Bay
Station. About $50 am. a peri
scope was sighted about 600 yards
from the lifeboat, then about 4
miles northeast Of the Emidio. The
periscope disappeared in few min.

the lifeboat for about five minutes
and then disappeared and was not
sighted again. The lifeboat reached
its base about 12:45 pm. without
further incident, Chief Churchill

 Reshuffling",BY WEBB MILLER United Press Staff COrreSp0ndent),"London, April 4 - (U.P) - The W d Il d scope of Winston Churchill's authority over the board strategic conduct of the war is the outstanding development in Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's cab inet re-Shuffle.

 As chairman of the committee of service ministers which meets regu- larly with the three chiefs of staff to make recommendations to the war cabinet on the principal fac- tors of the strategic situation and the progr S of operations, Churchill is now in position to put more boldness and initiative in the direction of the war.

 Otherwise Chamberlain,S re- shuffle was greeted tepidly or cri- tically by the press and public and it was unlikely to dissipate public feeling that the present cabinet is mot getting on"" sufficiently vigor- ously with the war.

 ""Puss In Corner""

 Even the pro-government Times characterizes the shuttle as ""like an elaborate game of puss in the cor ner"" and points out that in three cases ministers simply traded offices

 It is generally recognized that Chamberlain is hamstrung in any effort to broaden the political basis of his government by appointing odpposition leaders to cabinet posts, because labor party men have re- fused to enter the government and there is no sign of an alteration in their attitude.

 Chamberlain's re-shuffle recog- nized the fact that the masses are dissatisfied with the way the gov ernment is running the war. Inas- much as Churchill's prestige is higher than ever, the increase in his authority and the opportunity to

The match was regarded as the

newspaper dispatches from San

still in the dark as to what the

Senators are particularly con-

extent TO which the use of
armed force contributed by the
United States may be contem-

prior action by Congress.

LONDON. June 23.-Dissatis-
faction with Britain's military
leadership flared openly in the
House of Commons today as it
received it's first accounting OF
the defeat in Libya.


Although the heartening news
came that Britain's desert fighters
have been reinforced and that more
reinforcements are on the way, the
House learned that the naval side
of the Libyan struggle cost Britain
seven warships. including a light
cruiser. and 80 planes.


Clement Attlee, Dominions Secre-
tarv. made the report in the absence
of Prime Minister Churchill in the
United States. but offered little ex-
planation of the sharp, sudden set
back which pushed the British 9th
Army to the Egyptian border.


The House, apparently deter
mined to fix the blame for the de-
feat. cheered when Conservative Sir
John Wardlaw- Milne. from Mr..
Churchill's own party, declared that
some members mo longer have con-
fldence in the military direction of
the war""


When Mr.. Attlee suggested that

cried out from one of the benches:


why not?""


Churchilrs Overthrow Sought.


A group of members disclosed
that they were trying to get sufi-
cient signers to motion which II
passed would constitute an over
throw of Churchill and creation OF
a new cabinet.


The proposed motion asked Com
mons to declare 1T has no conn
dence in the central direction and
general strategy of the war"" and
appeared based on the old criti-
cism that Mr.. Churchill, as defense
minister, takes too large hand IN
military affairs.


Mr.. Attlee said the Axis lost
heavily in the twin convoy battle,
with a battleship torpedoed and a
cruiser of the 8-inch gun Trento
class and two destroyers sunk.

supply ships into Tobruk. he said,
and then steamed on toward Malta.

Harbor, addressing Congress the day
after Christmas in 1941, Winston
Churchill referred to Mussolini in a
scoring phrase of prophecy: THAT
boastful Mussolini,"" he said, has
crumbled already. He is now but
lackey and serf, the merest utensil
of his masters will""


It was harder to see it then. Six
months after that statement the Serf,
trailing as always his master, had in
f1icted blow on Allied hopes that
seemed catastrophe. The British
had been backed to the Ell Alamein
line, only eight miles from Alex
andria. For the Axis the prospect
was frightening again. 1t seemed
possible that they might regain all
they had lost since the swelling,
breast-beating Duce had told his
people: Now the die is cast, and our
will has burned our ships behind
u.s.""


But in the year just past, every
thing this man had sought to build
has collapsed about him. Now he is
through, kicked out like any other
faithless lackey, not by the master to
whom Mr.. Churchill referred but the
the very forces he set in motion two
decades ago-forces he sought to
guide but which neither he, nor any
other man, ever has been competent
to control. What does his partner
think, covering somewhere in Ger
many today? How grim, to him, must
be the lengthening shadows all about
him. cast by his own setting sun!
How he must dread the truth. when
can see the pattern of a parallel,
drawn with deadly certitude by &C
cumulating disaster.


For days the news has echoed the
internal havoc in Italy, wrought by
defeats around the outer rim and by
eruptions among the Italian people,
hopelessly beaten in war they never
wanted, sick with their suffering, be-
trayed by their leader. Marshal
Badoglio's thin words reveal more
clearly than any censored news dis
patch or broadcast the disruption
within, which he is called on now to
hold in check. If possible, until the
assurance OF peace brings with it
some hope of order. The beginning
OF the end? The people of Italy will
welcome the end now, If only for it's
promise Of new beginning."
